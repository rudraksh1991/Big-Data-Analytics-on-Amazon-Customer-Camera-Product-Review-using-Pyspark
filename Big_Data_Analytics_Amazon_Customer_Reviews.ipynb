You're pretty close.  One of the most important features of a 'security camera&#34; is the ability to detect motion and record, especially when running on battery and limited storage space.  I tested the motion detect on this camera in a few different environments so far (i.e. low light, indoors, outdoors, etc..) and all I got was a SD card full of video triggers.  All the testing was done with the low motion sensitivity setting.  I can't even imagine what the high one would be.<br />As others said, the low light operation is poor.  I did one of my tests outdoors as the sun was setting.  It was good until a point - then the camera started having seizures..it got fuzzy, went to black and white...back to color...then ultimately stabilized with lines across the screen.<br />Another oddity I noticed was that the firmware reported in the windows config tool seemed later than the latest version posed on the Zetta site.  I'm not exactly sure why that is.<br /><br />It gets two stars because there was one time, in a very light controlled indoor environment, where it didn't constantly trigger, so it MAY have some usefulness for your particular situation.  In adequate light, the video isn't too bad (you don't need HD for most security applications).<br /><br />The are a variety of settings that are configurable, which is quite nice.  One setting that could, and should, be configurable is the amount of time it will record after the last trigger is detected.  The manual states that this is 5 minutes.  So, if someone enters the picture for 30 seconds then leaves, you conceivably would have 5 minutes of recording nothing afterwards.  This isn't power or memory efficient.<br /><br />My original thought was to return this, but I want to crack it open and look at some of the internals.  I may decide to make my own.<br /><br />I will continue to test and report any new developments.","2015-08-31"],["US",47348933,"R1KWKSF21PO6HO","B006ZN4U34",789352955,"Celestron UpClose G2 10x25 Monocular, Black (71213)","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Exactly what I wanted and expected.","Exactly what I wanted and expected.

Upon opening the packaging it comes with a pack of paper, and a pain charging cable.  On the plus side it comes fully charged and ready to print<br /><br />I went to load the paper into the printer, and there are warnings about not to bend the paper, leave it in the car, standard stuff.  Loading the printer was as easy as sliding the top off, and dropping the pack barcode down in the printer.  Getting the top back on required a few flips to find the right direction since it doesn't clearly line up which side the top slides back on from.<br /><br />Note that the 2x3 print size is actually very small.  This should be obvious by the sizing, but make sure you understand what you are buying.  These aren't normal 3x5 photos even.<br /><br />My first attempt to print was using a non rooted android one plus one running lollipop(oxygen OS).  I went to the app store and downloaded the Zink app.  For some reason the app caused my phone to work very hard and heat up, I haven't had issues with other apps doing this.  One thing I did notice while using the app was NFC options.  Which is neat you just put your phone on the printer and it loads up the app for you, very convenient and a nice touch.<br /><br />While using the app it crashed several times on initial launch.  I tried to bluetooth pair the printer outside of the app and after a few attempts I was able to get it to pair.  However I was unable to print from the app with pairing the printer from the standard android bluetooth menu. I deleted the pairing and initiated the pair from within the app, this time it worked.<br /><br />When I finally got the printer working it popped up telling me there was a critical firmware update for the printer.  I let it download and apply the update via bluetooth.  It took about 5 minutes to update, and the instructions said to wait for the printer to restart.  The printer never restarted and required a power on, but the update worked successfully.<br /><br />I did find quite a few issues with the app.  The estimated percentage complete for sending to printer / printing was wildly inaccurate.  I received several out of memory errors when trying to load larger pictures.<br /><br />I also tried the same setup from an iPhone 6.  I downloaded the app, but was not given an option to pair bluetooth from within the app.  I did it from the system menu and it worked fine.  I didn't experience any crashes with smaller pictures.  The percentage completion bar was also more accurate.<br /><br />Printing take approximately 40 seconds to send to printer, and another 35 seconds to print.  While the printer is printing, it is pretty quiet.  It does have a bit of a high pitch tone to it, which could get annoying to some people.  The first print takes a bit longer since it &#34;prints&#34; the barcode you use when loading the printer.<br /><br />As for the quality of the prints, I used very high resolution DSLR pictures to try to pull the best photos possible from the little printer.  I noticed the colors are slightly muted, and the picture overall a bit darker.  Contrast was fairly low and there was a brownish tint to the photos, which almost looked like the standard instagram filter.  There was discoloring around the edges, and darker parts of photos were crushed into black. Some of the patterns such as on shirts, or with strands of hair remained, but gradual transitions looked muddy and unable to differentiate.<br /><br />The resolution was OK for the size of the photo.  They look fine from 1-2ft away.  Some of the photos I printed I aimed to capitalize on the look of the prints, including a nearly black and white photo of a flower.  These turned out really well.  While printing photos straight from the iPhone / One Plus One's camera resulted in even more muddying and lack of definition.<br /><br />I was not able to smudge the images after printing, and the printer didn't seem to get too hot.  Based on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.  There is an auto power off setting, but it seems the actual printing takes the majority of the battery.<br /><br />The prints end up being very expensive with the proprietary paper you have to buy.  Instead of making money on ink/film/the device, they are clearly aiming to make the profit on the paper.  Also note that I was provided a sample of this product for my unbiased review.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />Pros:<br />* Cool concept<br />* Makes stickers<br />* Decent battery life<br />* Fairly quick printing<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The quality of prints are low<br />* Android app needs work<br />* Very expensive per print<br />* Very small print size.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say this printer would be neat to print a quick sticker to put on something.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!","2015-08-31"],["US",34584405,"RK6ZADB3W80HN","B001NY1UJM",14533641,"CowboyStudio 220 Watt Photography Studio Monolight Flash Lighting Kit - 2 Studio Flash/Strobe","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Love it.","2015-08-31"],["US",16186864,"R2JF6AADBJXWPS","B002VPE1WK",839407277,"AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR/DSLR Cameras and Accessories - Black","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Great Case!","This case was a nice upgrade from my old bag.

Packed inside the box is the USB microscope, stand, USB cable, an installation software (CD) a manual, a quick start guide, and calibration chart.  However, if you do not have a CD&#60; you can get the manual and software online.  Assembly was easy and intuitive, taking about one minute.  The software installed on my Dell Windows 7 system with no issues.<br /><br />Simply plug the microscope into the computer and you are off and running.  The software of course interfaces with the computer and does so exceedingly well.  You can even open the interface software to a full window. To view objects, one knob provides general control and the other provides fine tuning.  This is perhaps where a more expensive unit might be better suited for some.  The fine tuning takes effort.  A variable light adjustment is provided on the cable, as well as a trigger/shutter control for the camera. The shutter button works very well and the software provides a means of organizing your images.  It is important to remember that there is no viewing piece on the microscope.

The camera itself is good, but I think the app is buggy.  It tends to just sit there and churn when I click on my camera to view it. There is a 2-3 sec delay on the video, which is okay, but sometimes the app freezes, so it doesn't show the correct picture.  However, you can turn the mic on and listen to what is happening?  But what good is that.  You have to manually turn of event recording while you are home, or else you get videos of you and your family doing your normal routines.  The free 1-day cloud storage is good, and most products don't have that.  Quality of the picture is very good whether day or night.  However, if you leave it on auto, it will probably be on night vision (black/white) when not home, as not enough lighting. I have to set it to off during the day, so I can see in color.  Alerts are very good, and spot on.  But I would only use that when away from your house, or else you will get a lot of phone alerts, unless you turn off event recording or the mobile alerts.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the phone app.  You can pan/tilt, but it's not a continuous movement, almost in frames, if that makes sense.  You can also manually set to record, but haven't checked to see how long it will run.  Overall good product, just wish they would fix the app issues, because those get frustrating.  Considering sending back and getting something else, but can't seem to find something better in the same price range with free cloud storage.  So really, really hoping they fix the app issues :)","2015-08-31"],["US",52801489,"R175BRS6TYJWAW","B004GK3TBC",842561002,"Halcyon Panasonic DMW-BMB9 BMB9 1500mAh 5 Year Warranty Replacement Panasonic Lithium Li-on Digital Camera Battery","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Fits My Lumix DMC-FZ70","When I bought my Panasonic LUMIX Dmc-FZ70, I knew I'd need a spare battery, but I wasn't sure that this would fit, especially since my particular model isn't listed on the product page.

I will note right away, if you do not own an iPhone are android phone this camera will likely not work for you. The setup is done through the app and without a phone that supports the app you will not be able to set the camera up.<br /><br />I found the camera setup to be relativity easy. You plug the camera in and then open up the app on your phone. From there you connect to the camera and setup the wifi password so that it can connect to your home network. One downside I did notice is that there is not a native app for the iPad. Because of this I ended up downloading the iPhone version of the app to my iPad and set it up that way. It would be nice if Kodak would make the app universal so that it wasn't so ugly on the iPad. This was my only complaint with the setup process.<br /><br />Using the camera for daily use is a breeze. The video quality is excellent and the pan/tilt feature allows you to see an entire room easily. The app also works well and allows you to set up notifications to alert you if motion is detected. This ensures that you will not miss anything moving in the room that you have the camera setup in. The app also gives you the ability to speak through a speaker that is on the camera, so if you have a pet you could easily speak to them remotely.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this camera is an excellent option for anyone that is looking for a home security camera. The quality is excellent and while the app is not the greatest, it does do its job well enough.","2015-08-31"],["US",34839788,"R2OM6OYRFC1EX5","B000BNY64C",853708552,"STK's Canon BP-511 2200mAh Battery for Select Canon Cameras (2 Pack)","Camera",1,0,0,"N","Y","Spam","Buyer Beware: After purchasing this, I begun getting spam email from SterlingTek.","2015-08-31"],["US",221141,"R18P3RW2HBRI5L","B00L2GJBOW",795532479,"Spy Pen Video Camera Audio Recorder By U-Guard Security Prod","Camera",5,0,1,"N","Y","Five Stars","Grest product","2015-08-31"],["US",50923817,"RDJN88ERJ3H04","B00HV4XHX0",629357110,"[2 PACK] Long Camera / Camcorder Neck Shoulder Straps Belt - Length Approximately 36\" + Cleaning Cloth in Retail Packaging (Multi-Color (Blue) + Black)","Camera",5,1,1,"N","Y","Fast and accurate; just as advertised.","Being a larger than average photographer, I was having a hard time finding a long enough strap so my camera would hang comfortably.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry. I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty. Please see the link below for the DVRs we offer at this time.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: http://defender-usa.com/products/DVRs.eng-12.html<br />9:39 AM Kristi: I can also offer coupon code CXB17, valid until September 30th, for a discount on most regular priced items on our site.<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: How much of a discount does the coupon code provide?<br />9:40 AM Kristi: 10%<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you how frustrated I am that a product I spent hundreds of dollars on and lots of time installing has broken and cannot be repaired just outside of one year.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: I have receipts for having the system professionally installed, which cost over $300.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: That is on top of the DVR system itself.<br />9:41 AM Kristi: I do apologize, William. What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website? There is an 8 Channel DVR with a 500 GB hard drive for $74.99.<br />9:49 AM Kristi: We are unable to offer a larger discount then 10%, regrettably.<br />9:50 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you that it is also frustrating that defender offers a telephone support line that, after dialing extensions for 15 minutes, merely re-routes you to the website.","2015-08-31"],["US",52432830,"R2KLKFHPR9GM6L","B00KLTG2J8",833529558,"Liquid Image 305G XSC-Xtreme Sport Cams LIC Hydra Series 12MP Mask Waterproof Video Camera with 1-Inch LCD","Camera",4,1,1,"N","Y","Great fun recording waves and surf","Great fun recording waves and surf.

Too bad, I really, really wanted this device to be the answer to an otherwise expensive prayer.  I got this for my husband who has been looking at the GoPro devices.  I didn't want him spending $300-400 on a 'toy' so I picked this one out for him.  It seems like a great idea: inexpensive action camera with GoPro mounting compatibility and lots of accessories as well.<br /><br />We got it and he put it on his motorcycle to get some video of his daily commute and travels.  It appears to have worked well for about 25 miles, then the video went wacky; in and out of focus, strange colors (it was shot at night, since that's when he goes to work), so something happened while it was mounted on the bike.  The next morning he shot his ride home during daylight and it became evident what happened: the IR pass filter had come loose and was wiggling about in the housing, causing color and focus issues.<br /><br />Too bad.  We did find the 'entry' level [[ASIN:B00NIYNUXO GoPro HERO (No Wi-Fi)]]and we'll give that a try next, but this one had to go back!  :(  Other than that, this really seemed like a great little unit with features that GoPro has for $300.  Great quality case and the wifi funtionality worked great.  The colors and pictures seemed high quality (until it went south, of course)  If one or the other of these Asian companies would institute a higher level of quality control, they could really rule the action cam market.

Then, when we tried to download the app on our phones, it said it didn't work with the older model. We returned it for this plug and play. You literally just scan the QR Code and within 5 minutes the whole thing is set up and works with the app. Image is fantastic and night vision looks great too. Tons of features that we probably won't even use, but good to have. Also has a mic and speaker so you can hear your baby and talk to them. You can set the volume in the app so that the alarm is more or less sensitive to sound. Highly recommend, especially for under $80!  Update: Feb 2017: Camera has had a lot of glitches over the 1.5yrs we've had it, including disconnecting from the wifi on a regular basis.

It has a red light that comes on when charging and it turns green when it is fully-charged. This charger also has overcharging protection, meaning that you can leave it plugged in overnight and it won't fry your battery! Considering a replacement 70D Canon battery runs about $60, it is VERY nice to have that extra protection! I actually missed that there would be a car charging cable included when I ordered this, so I was thrilled to find that cable in the box! I take a crazy number of photographs every day and one thing I'm not so good about is remembering to stop and charge the battery! This is extra cable plugs directly into the charger and allows you to charge your battery while you are on the go! I love having a car charger for vacations as well because how often do you remember, or have time to charge your camera battery at the hotel?

Heads up if you're using this on a Canon 5DMark2! On the newer 5DMark3 the issues are resolved.<br /><br />What I could not get past was battery power usage. I have never had a flash unit that would eat up through batteries so fast!  Some users complained about the unit wasting battery power when off. I did not test that so I can't say for sure. But under normal use, the same use as my old 560III's or the newer 560IV's, these things were abysmal! During a wedding, I'd be busy changing batteries all night long! Never an issue with the aforementioned units, which I'm still successfully using.<br /><br />Also, the firmware upgrade can ONLY be done on a Windows 32bit operating system. Insane!

It has rounded corners and a big screen, making the camera look good.  But I have concluded that In spite of increasing the optical zoom range, and increasing the imager from 12 to 16 megapixels, the 340HS is not as good a camera as it's predecessor, the 330HS.  I own both.<br /><br />The 330HS has the Digic5 processor, which is faster and allows the use of 3200 and 6400 ISO speeds with some loss of color quality but not horrible colored snow.  The 340HS has the older Digic4 processor which is capped at ISO 3200, and cannot take full images at the burst speed that the 330HS will do.  While increasing the optical zoom the designers reduced the maximum aperture from f3.0 to f3.6.  In low light you have the triple disadvantages of a slower lens, a less-capable processor, and more pixels crowded on an imager of the same size.<br /><br />But the worst part is that many of the manual features available on the 330HS are not present on the 340HS.  One that I miss is forced flash, such as you might want to use when your subject is backlighted by a window.  The camera also displays a ridiculous set of altered photos, including monochrome, of every photo you take.<br /><br />My 330HS connects wirelessly to my computer but I've been unable to get the 340HS to do so in spite of reading the manual and using Canon's wifi connection software.  I've read that others have made the connection successfully.<br /><br />The 340HS appears to be a triumph of style over substance.

While the footage does record, I am unable to access the card from PC including after unmounting from the camera setting. I am always asked to format it on my PC. I've tried three different computers and four memory sticks. It seems now the only way to get footage off is by clicking 'download' through the web interface and waiting in real-time for the footage to transfer. The interface is still just as horrendous and unusable as it was when I wrote my initial review so long ago.  The camera quality is acceptable but nothing out of the ordinary these days (it is comparable to the 808 #16 keychain camera, if that). It was easy enough to connect (you have to use physical LAN cable at first) but the built-in WiFi is weak and I found difficulty getting steady signal when it was placed one floor below while the rest of my WiFi-enabled devices worked fine. My biggest gripe is the horrendous interface they force upon you when accessing the camera through the web interface. First you are prompted to install some very cryptic and unknown proprietary plugin / ActiveX control that links to the &#34;Shenzhm Mining Technology&#34; website, which I guess is an affiliation of the developer of this camera. To get motion recording to work you have to enable the alarm action as well (which bombards your phone with notifactions with each motion until you disable notifications via the phone settings), and you cannot use the scheduler if using motion detection. I have set this up to point outside but had to then buy a mechanical timer to power the camera off at night and on in the day since there is no way to remotely power it off or schedule motion recording for only a particular period of time. When you want to see what has been recorded through the Web interface, you go to the &#34;Messages&#34; screen where each record appears twice (once for 'alarm motion' and oncefor 'record'). Only 30 rows are shown at a time and the thumbnail snapshots are microscopic at 80x40 pixels. You can view a larger snapshot by clicking the thumbnail but can only view one snapshot at a time and have to close it to open another instead of just having a prev/next button. The videos have no controls for playback and there is no natural way to download them from the device without taking the MicroSD card out. When you want to see more records you have to endlessly click &#34;More30Records&#34; which is a terrible UX design. I have taken to the extreme of manually modifying styles and local script behavior via Stylish and GreaseMonkey plugins to make the interface slightly more bearable. If you know the device's IP you can connect locally, connecting through their own site for viewing was very sluggish. Next time around I would spend a little more money for a more industry-standard IP camera.","2015-08-31"],["US",41904797,"R3K6DWMY9H76R2","B0036UTQLK",496402066,"ePhoto VL9026S3 3000 Watt Continuous Light Kit with Carrying Bag with 3 each of 6.5 Foot Tripod, 22x28-Inches Softboxes and Light Heads with 15 45W 5500k CFL Bulbs","Camera",3,0,0,"N","Y","good backdrop lights are okay--- wish I would have got ...","good backdrop<br />lights are okay---  wish  I would have got the LED-  screwing 5 bulbs into 3 bases makes them NOT really portable--- GO LED","2015-08-31"],["US",13734848,"R9JKLEV5CHZO9","B010LSAYMY",634765335,"GeekPro Pro 1 Wifi 12MP Full HD 1080P Sports Camera Waterproof Action DV 170° Wide Helmet Camcorder DVR Sport Camera Action Camera DV Camcorder","Camera",3,2,2,"N","Y","Very good quality.

The seller sold it from Singapore without disclosing it, so I didn't have warranty coverage in the U.S., but Amazon refunded me. There weren't any others of the same model available by that point, so I don't know for sure whether my issue was a one-off. But I sure hope so! ---  In replacing a Canon that cost just $70 over two years ago ([[ASIN:B004HW73S4 Canon Powershot A1200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom (Black)]]), I didn't have very demanding needs: I wanted a better zoom and USB charging instead of AA batteries, and similar or better picture quality. This Samsung made a good first impression but didn't live up to that standard.  It starts by turning on super-quickly, a revelation compared to my old Canon. But looks were deceiving -- you can't actually take a picture for the first few seconds after it comes on. The zoom pops out and the screen lights up, but if you press the button to take the picture, it gives you nothing. You have to release, wait a few seconds, then try again. Utterly infuriating when you've whipped out the camera to try and quickly shoot something before it's gone.  The picture quality also ranges wildly, from decent to unacceptable. A large number of pictures come out unfocused, and no adjustments changed that view from being a complete blur. At other times, colors come out fine at one second and unnatural the next, as in the examples. (White cars on a sunny day were particularly susceptible to being badly washed out.) Most of the time the camera's screen is clear enough to let you know that you have a bad picture and should try again; others no.  The camera isn't without merits. The zoom is great for such a compact camera, the WiFi was a nice feature, and the battery seems to have a pretty long life. But I can't count on it to take an adequate picture, to the point that on a recent trip I ended up ditching it into my backpack and settling for my phone. I'd figured that reliably taking okay pictures was a given even at a fairly low price, but apparently that's no longer the case. I'll be buying something higher-end.","2015-08-31"],["US",23176447,"R151GMT74SSHDU","B00004ZCJJ",642633790,"TiffenUV Protection Filter","Camera",3,0,0,"N","Y","Tiffen FIlter","As expected","2015-08-31"],["US",42047070,"R1FXZT47C1YZ4J","B008515KOM",736730522,"BM Premium NB-7L Battery For Canon PowerShot G10 G11 G12 SX30 IS Digital Camera","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Great battery life.","Bought this for my new Canon camera.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended.

I have owned this lens for many years now. Frankly, I have not been disappointed.  The lens is impressive as it yields sharp balanced images,  I was not really expecting much at the the time, but it has proven to be a good value.  Since then I have bought many other Lumix and Leica lenses for my G1 and GX7, but I still use this lens frequently.  Last week I decided to give away my entire Nikon system that I used in my profession, a tough decision letting go of and old friend, but I had not really picked it up since I bought this lens. This lens has dampened focusing, or so it seems, and is easy to focus accurately, it is certainly a faster focusing lens than my equivalent Nikkors.  It is light weight.  I carry it in a fishing vest, along with several other lenses. and it gets bounce and banged around when I scurry up and down slopes to get a good position and it has held up well.  In terms of image characteristics it performs similar to my Zeiss lenses on my Hasselblad.  I like to make oversized prints and this lens serves well.  Lumix makes so many good lenses it is hard to know which to buy, I don't regret this purchase.  As a user of may old lenses by Zeiss, Leica and Schneider I would put this lens in the same class. The selection of glass has always been highly subjective relative to one's photographic tastes, so look at some test images to get a feel for the lens.

Had to run all the cat6 wires to where I was going to set up my cameras since these are indoor camera wanted to make sure they did not get wet.  One thing that you must do before installing the camera is to program them to the NVR to make sure they work before you put them up. I suggest doing this first. The instructions are not to clear about doing this. I had to call Amcrest technical support for the NVR. It took a while to get through but they were very helpful and also assisted me setting up my phone app that I downloaded from the Play store. You have to download the right app for whatever phone you are using or it will not work. For the Samsung Galaxy phones I downloaded the  Amcrest view lite app. it work fine so far. Over all for the price these are pretty good cameras I like the option that the can pan and tilt to get a better view of the area. The have a built in speaker which I have not gotten to work with the NVR yet you can also use a Microphone with them still working on that. Write more at a later date when figured out how to make them work.","2015-08-31"],["US",3937898,"R2S4WC2QGJ3YIC","B00P0V0W1Q",654129912,"niceEshop(TM) Vintage Universal Camera Single Shoulder Sling Belt Strap For SLR DSLR Camera,Black White","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Vert sturdy.

If you are using a GE or Interlogix panel with this model it should be very easy to add to your existing system. Be sure to download your wireless panel's user manual, as you these smoke alarms usually need to go onto a dedicated group/zone, and be setup as a specific sensor. If you are using a monitored Concord 4 system, be sure to add the sensor text as &#34;smoke or fire alarm,&#34; and perhaps a location (which I did not as I don't really care where the fire or smoke is, I just want to know my house is on fire) so that the monitoring company will know that it's a fire emergency and not a police emergency. If you don't name this sensor I believe it will only tell the monitoring company that Sensor #XX has been tripped.

The SmapPole is longer than my other handle by about 4-5&#34; but this brings the camera further away giving a little bit more distance giving you a wider shot. I do see one thing that many mention, is that it has no grip built in the carbon fiber handle. This is very minor being that they include a detachable wrist lanyard that has an adjustable lock to keep it from sliding off your wrist. For those of you who have a mini tripod, you can screw the end of this handle to extend the height. All in all, I think this is a great product for the price being that it's made of real carbon fiber and all metal construction. I was given a sample product to evaluate and give my honest opinion.","2015-08-31"],["US",27562934,"R37GDD3HHEXBFF","B00XC46RWG",273550933,"Lightdow LD6000 WiFi 1080P HD Sports Action Camera Bundle with DSP:Novatek NT96655 Chip, 2.0-Inch LTPS LCD, 170° Wide Angle Lens and Bonus Battery","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","AWESOME ALTERNATIVE!","It's not a Gopro, know that when you buy it, HOWEVER, it's pretty awesome.

Some accessory kits include one or two items, and you have to buy dozens of different kits in order to get everything that you need. This kit from Baxia Technology literally has everything that you need for your GoPro Camera.<br /><br />First of all, I was overwhelmed by the number of pieces included in this set. I know it states exactly what is included, but wow, when you see it all together, it's a lot of pieces. You immediately wonder will I ever use all of this? And chances are, you won't. But, if you have a GoPro Camera, you will probably use a good portion of it. I waited awhile to write this review because I wanted a chance to truly test each part of this kit before writing the review.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed about this kit was that there are no instructions. None whatsoever. There is nothing labeling the pieces that are included, no booklet showing you how to use the included pieces, and no usage tips or tricks. Basically you are left to figure things out, and if you can't, you are up a creek because there is no documentation, not even a product box to help you. All of these pieces come in a resealable bag, similar to a Ziploc, not very sturdy for the number of pieces included. There is a very nice velvet pouch with a drawstring included that is black and says Baxia on it. I don't know about you, but I hate to be a walking advertisement for companies, so I was disappointed to see their logo on the pouch, especially since it will be holding GoPro Camera accessories, which no one will know or recognize the Baxia name in association with it.<br /><br />Here is what is included:<br />Head belt strap mount<br />Chest belt strap mount<br />Helmet strap mount<br />Extendable handle monopod<br />Floating handle grip<br />Floating block with 3M adhesive pad<br />Wrist strap mount<br />360 degree rotary clip mount<br />Bike handlebar holder mount<br />Adjustable car suction cup mount<br />Three way adjustable pivot arm with surface quick release buckle<br />Three way adjustable pivot arm without surface quick release buckle<br />2 tripod mount adapters<br />2 surface J hook buckles<br />2 surface quick release buckles<br />3 long screw bolts<br />1 short screw bolt<br />2 flat mounts<br />2 arc mounts<br />5 flat 3M adhesive pads<br />5 curved mount adhesive pads<br />Storage pouch<br />Safety buckle<br /><br />The strap mounts are really well made, but they are definitely not one size fits all. I would say they are more like one size fits most. The head belt strap is very comfortable and does not dig in to you as long as you have a relatively normal sized head. If you have a head that's on the larger side, you will find it uncomfortable. The chest belt strap mount is great if you are a size XL or smaller, again, very comfortable, but if you are on the larger side, you'll find the strap uncomfortable. The helmet strap really depends on the helmet. It fit on two bike helmets we tried, but didn't fit a third. It fit on two skateboard helmets, but wouldn't fit a roller blade helmet, and unfortunately it doesn't fit motorcycle helmets. The wrist strap mount will comfortably fit a 7 or 8 inch wrist, but it did not fit comfortably on a plus sized wrist (9&#34; wrist).<br /><br />The straps overall are very comfortable, do not dig into you, and enable you to mount the GoPro Camera securely, so it doesn't feel like it's going to fall.<br /><br />The monopod is one of the best pieces in this kit. Very high quality and extends out like crazy (almost 40&#34;). It holds the GoPro Camera very tightly and securely, and it doesn't feel like the camera is too top heavy even when it's fully extended. It makes it great for capturing scenes that are far away, or when there is a large crowd of people. I have seen monopods alone sell for a little over half the price of this kit, and it's most definitely high quality, and not a cheap plastic monopod like some I have seen.<br /><br />The floating pieces in this kit are the &#34;weak link&#34; in my opinion. The floating handle grip does in fact float, but it's not heavy enough to keep your camera from going for a swim, and getting away from you. The floating block is very disappointing as well, because as soon as it gets fully saturated, it no longer floats on top of the water, but sort of tries to bob just under the surface of the water. The floating handle grip looks so nice, it just is no match for the heavy GoPro Camera.<br /><br />The 360 degree rotary clip mount is awesome, and I mean awesome. The clip on this mount is the most amazing clip that I have ever seen on a camera accessory. It will clip to literally anything and is very durable. The teeth tightly clamp down on the surface that you clipped it to, and it does not cause any kind of damage to the clip. The clip is pretty much unbreakable, I tried clipping it to a variety of different surfaces...plastic, metal, steel, chrome, and it clipped tightly to each surface without any problems or slipping.<br /><br />The bike handlebar holder mount is pretty weak. It fits some bikes that don't have thicker bars, but didn't fit either the mountain bike or road bike that we tried it on. It fit well on the beach cruiser bike though. I was disappointed with the fit of it, and even when there was a good fit, like on the beach cruiser, the mount would slide around and not stay firmly in place. It is one of the weaker mounts in the kit in my opinion.<br /><br />The adjustable car suction cup mount is another awesome product in this kit, for me, the price of this item and the price of the monopod alone make this kit worthwhile. The suction cup is the kind that is tight fitting and it doesn't slide around. It stays firmly on not only car dash boards, but also on the windshield, and on non car surfaces like filing cabinets and counter tops. This is one of my favorite mounts included in this set. It literally attaches to everything. It holds the GoPro Camera so tightly you don't have to worry about things getting out of control while you are using it.<br /><br />The pivot arms are so so. One has a quick release buckle and one doesn't. The quick release buckle to me makes the pivot arm feel &#34;less secure&#34; because I worry about it releasing on it's own. It hasn't yet, but it feels like it could. The pivot arms don't really hold the GoPro Camera tightly. They felt weak compared to the other mounts in this set. The tripod mount adapters are really nice and give extra stability to the GoPro Camera when it's mounted on a tripod. It feels like the GoPro isn't going anywhere, and that's a great feeling.<br /><br />The buckles are very high quality. They don't become &#34;less tight&#34; with continuous use. The J hook buckles are my favorite they feel like they really provide the GoPro the support it needs and won't weaken over time. They are made of really high quality materials and they don't have the whiting or fading that some buckles do with continued use. The quick release buckles, I'm not a fan of, and I've stopped using them, they just don't feel like they stay securely in place to me, no matter what I tried.<br /><br />The screw bolts are very well made, and there are 3 long ones and 1 short one. They are very nice, sturdy, and are not cheap feeling at all. They fit a variety of cameras, not just the GoPro which is nice. They are made of plastic with metal bolts, but it's not really weak plastic and feels substantial.<br /><br />The mounts are extremely well made and durable. They don't bend while in use, or cave in under the weight of the GoPro, something I was worried about when I first saw them. There are two flat mounts and 2 arc mounts, and they are easy to mount and then un-mount using the included 3M adhesives.<br /><br />While I'm talking about the 3M adhesives, most of them were unusable. Because all of the pieces in this kit are just tossed into a bag, the 3M adhesives were bent in the shipping process, and when removed from the bag, some of them no longer had the protective coverings on, some were too bent to use, and some didn't stick at all. Out of the 5 flat adhesive pads, one was sticky enough to use. Out of the 5 curved mount adhesive pads 2 were sticky enough to use. I tried some of those that were bent and no longer felt sticky, but there was no getting them to stick. Getting the 3M adhesive off of the surface once stuck also proved to be challenging and I was happy to have Goo Gone standing by which worked wonders. I would like to see them be no mess adhesives that didn't leave goo behind on your surfaces.<br /><br />At the end of the day, there are some really useful pieces in this kit (the clip, the monopod, and the car mount to name three); there are some pieces that I wish worked better (like the floating pieces); and there are some things that missed the mark all together (the 3M adhesives, the lack of instructions to name two). It's a good kit, but not a great kit. Is it a must have for a GoPro Camera, not really. There are some pieces you will use and a lot of &#34;fluff&#34; pieces that you likely won't use, depending on how you use your GoPro Camera.<br /><br />I was provided with this accessory kit for free in exchange for my honest review.included in this set. It literally attaches to everything. It holds the GoPro Camera so tightly you don't have to worry about things getting out of control while you are using it.<br /><br />The pivot arms are so so. One has a quick release buckle and one doesn't. The quick release buckle to me makes the pivot arm feel &#34;less secure&#34; because I worry about it releasing on it's own. It hasn't yet, but it feels like it could. The pivot arms don't really hold the GoPro Camera tightly. They felt weak compared to the other mounts in this set. The tripod mount adapters are really nice and give extra stability to the GoPro Camera when it's mounted on a tripod. It feels like the GoPro isn't going anywhere, and that's a great feeling.<br /><br />The buckles are very high quality. They don't become &#34;less tight&#34; with continuous use. The J hook buckles are my favorite they feel like they really provide the GoPro the support it needs and won't weaken over time. They are made of really high quality materials and they don't have the whiting or fading that some buckles do with continued use. The quick release buckles, I'm not a fan of, and I've stopped using them, they just don't feel like they stay securely in place to me, no matter what I tried.<br /><br />The screw bolts are very well made, and there are 3 long ones and 1 short one. They are very nice, sturdy, and are not cheap feeling at all. They fit a variety of cameras, not just the GoPro which is nice. They are made of plastic with metal bolts, but it's not really weak plastic and feels substantial.<br /><br />The mounts are extremely well made and durable. They don't bend while in use, or cave in under the weight of the GoPro, something I was worried about when I first saw them. There are two flat mounts and 2 arc mounts, and they are easy to mount and then un-mount using the included 3M adhesives.<br /><br />While I'm talking about the 3M adhesives, most of them were unusable. Because all of the pieces in this kit are just tossed into a bag, the 3M adhesives were bent in the shipping process, and when removed from the bag, some of them no longer had the protective coverings on, some were too bent to use, and some didn't stick at all. Out of the 5 flat adhesive pads, one was sticky enough to use. Out of the 5 curved mount adhesive pads 2 were sticky enough to use. I tried some of those that were bent and no longer felt sticky, but there was no getting them to stick. Getting the 3M adhesive off of the surface once stuck also proved to be challenging and I was happy to have Goo Gone standing by which worked wonders. I would like to see them be no mess adhesives that didn't leave goo behind on your surfaces.<br /><br />At the end of the day, there are some really useful pieces in this kit (the clip, the monopod, and the car mount to name three); there are some pieces that I wish worked better (like the floating pieces); and there are some things that missed the mark all together (the 3M adhesives, the lack of instructions to name two). It's a good kit, but not a great kit. Is it a must have for a GoPro Camera, not really. There are some pieces you will use and a lot of &#34;fluff&#34; pieces that you likely won't use, depending on how you use your GoPro Camera.<br /><br />I was provided with this accessory kit for free in exchange for my honest review.","2015-08-31"],["US",52620275,"R3D3H6IVZ6YPK7","B004LXGXAI",83951891,"DURAGADGET Large Holster / Top-loader case / Bag / For Digital SLR Cameras (Large Zoom Lenses) Compatible with Canon EOS 750D / 700D / 650D / 300D / 350D / 400D / 40D / 30D / 5D / 1000D / 450D / SX1 / 500D / 50D / SX1 / SX10 / SX110 / SX120 / 7D / SX10 / SX110 / SX120 / 7D / 1D / 450D / Digital Rebel XSi / 50D / EOS 1000D / 30D / 1000D / 500D / 5D / 7D / 450D / 1D / 50D / 5D Mark II / PowerShot G1","Camera",5,1,1,"N","Y","Five Stars","Worked great for my canon 6D","2015-08-31"],["US",27176048,"RQG24Q4C1Z0H0","B00BIK06FU",859280954,"Sony ALC-F405S Front Lens Cap for SELP1650 lens (Black)","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","perfect.","2015-08-31"],["US",32365909,"R3NPWSFYPZCZ9N","B00M6JCEHA",542855118,"iKross HDMI Cable","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Cable came quickly and works great!","2015-08-31"],["US",49561093,"R1BQPSKTXLX8EE","B00MHPAES4",126838413,"Sony a5100 16-50mm Mirrorless Digital Camera with 3-Inch Flip Up LCD (Black)","Camera",4,0,1,"N","N","No IR receiver","SONY engineering always seem to make weird design decisions.<br /><br />This time,  they removed the IR receiver which has been available in all previous models.<br /><br />So I can flip the LCD screen 180 degree but there is no easy way to trigger the shutter.

It's about on par with my iPhone ...","I got this camera as a gift way back in 2007.  Obviously, camera technology has improved a lot over the past couple years, and this camera hasn't really withstood the test of time.  I didn't really need a point and shoot camera back in 2007 so I just kind of stuffed this thing in my closet and forgot about it.  Now, I realized I wanted a cheap point and shoot for taking short videos during my upcoming cruise.  So I busted this out of my closet to see if it still worked.  Luckily, it did.  I've been playing with it for the past few days, and here's what I've observed:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Picture Quality: Shoots decent quality photos/video (I wasn't expecting much, but the picture quality is pretty good.  It's about on par with my iPhone 5.)<br />-Easy to Use: Simple and easy to use (It's bare bones, but all the controls and menus are pretty intuitive.)<br />-Feels Good: The camera feels good in my hand.  It's easy to hold and has a good weight to it.<br />-Tripod Mount: Has a place for a tripod<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Battery Life: It takes 2 AA batteries, which may be a con for some people and may be a pro for others.  However, the batteries don't last very long.  I put in 2 brand new batteries and they died after shooting about 15 minutes of video and taking 3 pictures.  I thought maybe I had used some bad batteries, so I tried again with 2 new ones.  Same thing, died after about 15 minutes of video.  Not sure how many pictures you can take with the battery life though.<br />-Memory Card Placement: The memory card slot is in the same place the batteries are.  So every time you need to change/remove the memory card, you have to finagle around the batteries which fall out easily.  Not a huge deal, but still a slight annoyance.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good camera to just goof around with, maybe give it to a young kid.  I wouldn't use this as your go-to camera, especially if you want to shoot video.","2015-08-31"],["US",27825061,"R2BITM4CIQ1Z33","B00NWXY076",47021726,"3DR IRIS+ (915) Quadcopter","Camera",5,0,1,"N","Y","Better than all the rest of the quads in the 600 hundred dollar range 10 out of 10","Read up on this, Phantom needs to watch out as 3DR is in the fast lane and passing all the other quads in the phantom price range.

It has legitimately never let me down in my one year (almost) of ownership and I'll probably order 2 or 3 more in the coming months as my other contour mounts age.  The only issue I can think of is that pairing this with super cheap aftermarket gopro adapter stick things (you know... the little sticks with the bolts through them) requires you to torque the living heck out of the bolts (I keep a multi tool with me anyways... so not a problem for me).

I first looked at what reviews I could find, such as the couple of reviews on Youtube and a few on Amazon. Since it is such a new camera there is not a lot of info out there, so I was taking a bit of risk.  First thing upon receipt was to connect up my laptop to the camera directly, and get the IP set up and so on. I found that in the current generation of firmware, you are now forced to change the user name and password immediately, a good thing. However what is not made clear is that the firmware will no longer accept a new “weak” password – the new password must be either “medium” or “strong” to be accepted. The error message from the Foscam Client rejecting your new password attempts doesn’t make this clear. A bit of trial and error, and I figured it out.  Next step was to upgrade the firmware. The instructions on the firmware update downloaded from the Foscam site are pretty detailed and clear. System firmware version: 1.11.1.4, App firmware version: 2.74.1.7_p1, Plug-in version: 3.3.0.7. Now time to check out more fully.  The basics worked via the Foscam Client. While I have not had hardware problems with Foscam cams, I have always had problems trying to use their various applications, and so use their camera for the hardware functionality ONLY, and rely on a Synology NAS box running Surveillance Station 7 to talk to the cameras and do the data storage, motion detection, remote access, all outside of the cameras. Surveillance Station and their iOS application DS Cam are both very solid in my experience. Looking to Foscam software to do this functionality is &#34;problematic&#34; to put it kindly - look at the reams of postings over months and years with problems. Give up and look for another solution, don't expect that a firmware update will miraculously solve this.When I tried to add the new FI9900P to Synology Surveillance Station, no luck. From a quick check online I found that this camera is not yet supported in native form by applications such as Blue Iris or Synology Surveillance Station. That is not a surprise for a new camera, and hopefully will be addressed in the days ahead.  Initially I was unable to connect to the camera from Synology SS even as a Generic Camera, using the standard ONVIF protocol. I tried both Synology SS 7, and the open source utility ONVIF Device Manager v2.2.250. I was able to connect up to my FI19831P cameras on the same network on non-default ports no problem via ONVIF, but not the FI9900, so I knew that the problem is the FI9900p camera, not the utility or my network. I talked to Foscam US tech support and they indicated that ONVIF would be implemented in a firmware update in about 1 month (say early October).  I was about to give up, but then today I saw the review by Alex noting that he had got Synology SS to connect to the FI9900P using the ONVIF default port 888, so I changed the ONVIF port back to the default of 888 and gave it a try - success! So it looks like ONVIF support is in fact in place in the FI9900P, but may have some bugs such as currently only working with the default port 888. However that's a good start, and with communications established I can now try out the logging and recording on the Synology SS.  A few more tips / observations:  1) For daylight savings time (DST) you still need to set the offset to 30 so as to get a 60 minute delta in your camera time, not set to 60 like you would expect. This applies to many Foscam (and other China- sourced) current IP cameras. I don't understand the rationale, but at least I can make it work and get the correct time.  2) The HDR video setting seemed to make things worse (picture very dark rather than better, so I left it off.  3) Some of the documentation in the HIKVISION Network Camera User Manual v5.1.0, and downloadable from their site, is quite pertinent to Foscam cameras, and much more detailed and explanatory (such as the explanation around password validity, DST setting, video settings, etc.)  4) for future IP camera acquisition I am going to look more closely at HIKVISION and Dashua as alternatives to Foscam.  Hope this helps others.","2015-08-31"],["US",11448821,"R1PDN31H34RZKO","B00I3J4NG2",165753185,"DJI Battery for Phantom 2 and Phantom 2 Vision (White)","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Very good","2015-08-31"],["US",45107283,"R1B4DLOZ1JS2LA","B00HJGYGV2",735764908,"Rec-mounts Picatinny Rail Mount Type1 for Gopro [Rec-b35-s]","Camera",4,0,1,"N","Y","Four Stars","Love my gadgets thank you","2015-08-31"],["US",49442569,"R1DPO1E6UHH3Z4","B00MUQER5Q",38953458,"Action Camera 4K WiFi Camera 16MP WIMIUS Q1 Ultra HD Sports Waterproof Camera Include Waterproof Case","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","very good","2015-08-31"],["US",30643592,"R2A4CE6T3J9ET2","B00BW6LXHA",673687626,"Canon SL1 Bundle","Camera",5,1,1,"N","Y","Five Stars","Very good beginners slr camera.

This definitely has more attachments and accessories included. All of the stats are very similar as well. It is a complete package with lots of great useful pieces included.<br /><br />You can record video, capture a single photo, capture photo burst, shoot a series of photos of the set interval time, watch video and photo playback adjust camera settings and resolutions and much more. Its quick to pick up even for the not so tech savvy. I count myself in that group. It literally does it all. If you're into filming or shooting photos this is definitely for you. The video is extremely high HD quality.<br /><br />We have really enjoyed learning about this camcorder. We have been testing its abilities. I love that it's versatile. If you can dream it up I guarantee there's a mount out there for it. I'm working on filming my cooking for my blog currently. I'm a chef by trade. I find this camera easy to use and operate by myself. This camera is perfect for a one person operation. Since, I'm cooking, I really like that it's water resistant. Spills happen! It really is a professional quality HD camera. It's amazing to me that it fits in the palm of my hand. This is perfect for using solo you can mount it easily to most anything.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this for everyone. Once you get it you'll think of 1 million reasons to use it. The audience for this camera and equipment is endless. It would make a great gift for anyone. It's not just for sports enthusiast. New parents or grandparents,<br />College-bound students, entrepreneurs, anyone with a YouTube channel, teachers or most everyone would love to receive this as a gift.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry.

What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website?

So I still hope it is truly waterproof camera. It is yet to be tested for me. I am not planning to snorkel or dive with it. It tells on the box 15 meters which makes for about 50 feet. Well, I would divide it at least by 3 if not by 5 for true water depth that camera would hold. I don't see any heavy rubber around buttons and when you push button in and there is not protective rubber, there is a crack between the body and the button, I would expect. So I would not expect it to work under water. If it does, Great!<br />I am a fisherman, so I expect just have this camera to work on the river, lake or the ocean surface or above it, and if dropped in the water, not to leak in and spoil the pictures. That would be enough waterproof for me.<br /><br />As many mentioned here flash is weak and making pictures indoors is pretty poor, especially if the picture should have depth or you snapping an object in the somewhat not too bright light from 5-7 yards. Anything closer than 3 yards is more or less ok. And again, that is exactly the purpose I bought it for. Make pictures in close range and outside of the house.<br /><br />My issue mostly with the kit. It is not high quality stuff. But 32 Gb memory card and extra battery set is helping. The belt with floatant that should keep camera floating if it fail to the water was failure. That small thin thread that should be rapped around the camera handle and hold it to floatant got out of the plastic housing right after I pull it out of the plastic rap. I don't think it is seller fault, as all items were in the sealed plastic. Most probably poor manufacturing. The hole in the plastic housing very small. Luckily I have experience working with small parts and have required tools to pool that thread through the small hole in the plastic and tie a little knot on the end of the thread. So all fixed anddone.<br /><br />There is that, my review for now.","2015-08-31"],["US",526554,"R2C0H0DOC0EQSZ","B00W5YHC1E",139855759,"1000TVL Bullet Security Camera 960H CCTV White Tube 1/3\" VandalProof 72 IR LEDs","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Excellent item","2015-08-31"],["US",36076198,"R2ZZGPLN38LNKJ","B003TTTFN2",189429296,"Tamrac 5788 Evolution 8 Photo Digital SLR Camera Sling Backpack (Black) with Lenspens + Accessory Kit Combo for Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Fuji &amp; Sony Alpha Cameras","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Fantastic bag for any trip","This bag has gone on 3 trips, through all kinds of different weather, and hasn't started to show sign one of wear and tear.

STOP!!!  I had cracked my screen and needed to replace it.  The seller shipped this part quickly and it was in good condition, but it doesn't work properly on my camera.  The manufacturer claims that it fits several different cameras---which it does---and it does fit the HX-300 just fine.  The problem: the LCD doesn't let the light through, so that even though the backlight is working fine and is super bright, when it's all put together it's very dark/dim as if there's no backlight at all.  In fact, I can see the menus and I can see what the lens is capturing, but everything is very faint and hard to see.  I tested it without the backlight plugged in, and it was totally dark, which confirmed that the backlight itself is working, but is not the problem.  I spoke to a camera technician who explained that despite the claim the manufacturers make, this replacement screen is NOT compatible with the camera, electronically.  As a result, it's not working right.  He said the only screen he kneows that is compatible with my camera at this point is a &#34;Sony original replacement screen,&#34; and he steered me to a site that sells genuine Sony replacement parts: https://sony.emcompass.com/item/9596986/Sony/1-811-762-11/Lcd_Module  I purchased the part and it works like a charm.  Unfortunately, I had to pay $80 instead of $20 :-(  (I'm not even going to try to get a refund...)  Note: on the plastic wrap that came with the screen, there was a label with the number S8200 on it.  Could it be that this screen is actually designed to work with the Nikon S8200---which also has a 3&#34; backlit screen?  Note #2: By the way, there is an awesome video on Youtube with great step-by-step instructions on how to remove the old screen and replace it with the new one.","2015-08-31"],["US",10002604,"R1XNQ8C8VZ5LZE","B007TPS9PC",358790036,"Foscam Wireless Range 9dbi Antenna Expander for Foscam IP Camera - Black","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Works a treat","2015-08-31"],["US",23871436,"RREY335F6NIS2","B00MNG37C2",857397110,"Syma X5C 2.4G 6 Axis Gyro HD Camera RC Quadcopter with 2.0MP Camera","Camera",3,0,0,"N","Y","but great to learn on","Not as expected, but great to learn on.","2015-08-31"],["US",42920584,"R1NBSH81U5FMFI","B00K8MTQGY",593898174,"VSGO DSLR Camera Full-Frame Sensor Cleaning Swabs Kits","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","It was gift","2015-08-31"],["US",20271497,"R2PL50KJ19VTJ1","B00LBS9PZ6",551038944,"Mudder 5 Inches Tactical Hand Grip Mount Handheld Stabilization Handle Aluminium Alloy (Black) for GoPro Action Video Camera HD HERO2, HERO3, HERO3+","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Fantastic Gopro handle used with Gopro Hero 4 and 3+ ...","Fantastic Gopro handle used with Gopro Hero 4 and 3+ Black.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry. I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty. Please see the link below for the DVRs we offer at this time.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: http://defender-usa.com/products/DVRs.eng-12.html<br />9:39 AM Kristi: I can also offer coupon code CXB17, valid until September 30th, for a discount on most regular priced items on our site.<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: How much of a discount does the coupon code provide?<br />9:40 AM Kristi: 10%<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you how frustrated I am that a product I spent hundreds of dollars on and lots of time installing has broken and cannot be repaired just outside of one year.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: I have receipts for having the system professionally installed, which cost over $300.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: That is on top of the DVR system itself.<br />9:41 AM Kristi: I do apologize, William. What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website? There is an 8 Channel DVR with a 500 GB hard drive for $74.99.<br />9:49 AM Kristi: We are unable to offer a larger discount then 10%, regrettably.<br />9:50 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you that it is also frustrating that defender offers a telephone support line that, after dialing extensions for 15 minutes, merely re-routes you to the website.","2015-08-31"],["US",34584405,"R1BL90Y3MBW734","B00O9RTDE4",79314974,"Neewer PRO i-TTL FlashDeluxe Kit for NIKON DSLR D7100 D7000 D5300 D5200 D5100 D5000 D3200 D3100 D3300 D90 D800 D700 D300 D300S D610, D600, D4 D3S D3X D3 D200 N90S F5 F6 F100 F90 F90X D4S D SLR Camera- Includes: Neewer VK750 II Auto-Focus Flash + Wireless Trigger +N1-Cord & N3-Cord Cables + Hard & Soft Flash Diffuser + Lens Cap Holder","Camera",2,3,5,"N","Y","Can not use it for what I wanted","I got this thinking I could work it with my lights and flash on my camera.

Korner is so simple that my mother could set it up. It's pretty fun too. Just add a couple of remote CCTV cameras and you'll have an awesome home security system for very little money.

It came with a kit that has all the parts you need to utilize this camera the way you'd want. The camera seems fragile but it isn't. Good quality camera that has all the functions. It's so tiny too and has a screen. It has fish eye lens that can zoom 4x. The wifi is cool that you can transfer image to your phone or tablet. It's just an awesome little camera. It's durable though. I played catch with my son and he wore it and the football would smash into the camera and the camera even took a tumble and it still maintained as though nothing happened. The price is super amazing. I got it as a lighting deal and it was a steal of a deal in my opinion. Thanks<br /><br />Now the cons are that there's no instructions manual. I feel like there's a lot more that I should be able to do but can't do it yet. Then again it's fun discovering new things about a device, but a link to instructions would be nice. Also there's so many attachment kits and it's hard to know what is what. A YouTube link showing all the feature would be awesome to solve this. The app could also be better. It's a bit laggy and slow. Maybe that's my device though. The buttons are so hard to figure out sometimes. I have trouble playing back the clip and fast forwarding. Also for some reason it stops recording at certain times. Like it'll record for a minute and stop and start a new clip. Again I feel that all falls on the functionality and instructions would help this. There may be a instruction link that I don't know of. If I do find it I'll use it and come back here to revise this review.<br /><br />Overall I gave this item a 5 star rating and rightfully so. It's a fun device that can be used by anyone for a wide range of things and the best part is that it's very cost effective. Also the quality and functionality of this camera is top notch. My kids have already asked for one for Christmas and I may oblige.","2015-08-31"],["US",41194421,"R1RRP40IAHLIFU","B00RH5REMS",331701391,"Selfie Stick, Noot® Groupie Self Portrait [Battery Free] Extendable Handled Stick with Adjustable Phone Holder Mount & Built-in Remote Shutter Designed for Apple & Android Smartphones","Camera",1,0,0,"N","Y","Poor quality","Poor quality.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry. I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty. Please see the link below for the DVRs we offer at this time.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: http://defender-usa.com/products/DVRs.eng-12.html<br />9:39 AM Kristi: I can also offer coupon code CXB17, valid until September 30th, for a discount on most regular priced items on our site.<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: How much of a discount does the coupon code provide?<br />9:40 AM Kristi: 10%<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you how frustrated I am that a product I spent hundreds of dollars on and lots of time installing has broken and cannot be repaired just outside of one year.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: I have receipts for having the system professionally installed, which cost over $300.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: That is on top of the DVR system itself.<br />9:41 AM Kristi: I do apologize, William. What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website? There is an 8 Channel DVR with a 500 GB hard drive for $74.99.<br />9:49 AM Kristi: We are unable to offer a larger discount then 10%, regrettably.<br />9:50 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you that it is also frustrating that defender offers a telephone support line that, after dialing extensions for 15 minutes, merely re-routes you to the website.","2015-08-31"],["US",41466286,"R19U7UEI5FHKAH","B00TKLFA6O",443308689,"OP/TECH USA Utility Sling Duo","Camera",5,0,1,"N","Y","Distribute the weight of a heavy SLR","This item is exactly what I have been looking for.

Just like the underwater filters, these land filters fit very snugly/securely and your saving $40 when you buy a Three Pack over buying three filters individually. Polar Pro appears to have listened to feedback about their included synthetic tether because all three of my tethers that came with my pack (my Land Three Pack appears to be the newest version due to the Polar Pro's new logo on the storage bags compared to the old logo that was on my Underwater Three Pack storage bags) had their ends singed to prevent unraveling.

This is an outdoor camera. I have it underneath the eve of the house out of direct rain and sun. Nevertheless the screen fogged up a couple of times and never seemed to clear properly. I now have permanent spot on the image where the picture is blurry at night because the night time LEDs are also behind the same clear cover.<br /><br />2.<br /> the camera sometimes stops recording events to the SD card. It was not out of space, and I also had overwrite checked. The only way to fix this was to restart it. There is no remote restart so I have to go and physically unplug it to restart, another poor design non feature.<br /><br />3.<br /> I just reformatted the SD card while it was in the unit (note this is an SD card that has been in there for months recording events)  and once it finished it no longer recognised the SD card. I likely have to take it out and format FAT in my PC to make it work. Yes I did restart it.<br /><br />4.<br /> The biggest fault of all is the fact that I have to use Samsung servers to retrieve recorded events from the SD card. This actually would be ok if it worked. Most of the time it fails to connect or &#34;loses connection&#34; half way through playback. If you are thinking that this is because I have a bad network that is not so. My camera is on a LAN ( I tried wireless and everything was worse when accessing the camera on WiFi) Both inside my home and out on a cell network the camera access is flaky and not reliable at all and is soo slow. Mush of the time the system says the servers are down or are going down for maintenance. This would be ok since its free IF they gave another option for retrieving the event recordings.<br /><br />5.

This killed 2 birds with one stone...birthday gift done and no more complaining....at least about that.<br /><br />The calendar feature is nice and the remote control works pretty well.  I'm not convinced the motion sensor is working correctly but will need to give it some more time to make sure.  The key of course is will it last and I will come back in edit to give those of you on the edge of your seats closure.  Did not try the video yet but supported movie formats are just bones.<br /><br />It definitely has a bit of cheap feel but image quality was decent.

There seem to be about 10 different camera brands all using the same construct.  The weakness of this product is the firmware and software.  Even the P2P doesn't work very well.  I had to run it 3 times to get both cameras to actually connect.  The browser plugin for the cloud viewer lacks all the usable features of the mobile software.  Sadly, as soon as you leave the WiFi connection with your mobile device, it no longer connects through the web.  You have to switch to port-forwarding and reset your cameras to use a static IP address so it doesn't keep disconnecting.  If you use Port forwarding, P2P no longer works.  Port Forwarding can also corrupt your router settings, particularly if you have more than 1 camera.  It shouldn't be this difficult to use these cameras.  The software should be able to either install these properly without intensive intervention, but that's still a dream at this point.  Documentation is useless.  And forget calling the help line or trying to use the included remote installation card from Foscam.  Average wait time on hold is more than an hour.  Great software / app opportunity here for someone to develop and exploit this weakness.  Bracket design doesn't space camera far enough from wall to allow space for antenna.

I have an a-mount with a fairly cheap dummy adapter that works perfectly with my camera. I am able to take amazing shots, even in low light, that I was never able to do with the kit lens. I actually dread using the kit lens now, and have considered just getting rid of it and getting a smaller focal length prime Rokinon to replace it, as this 85mm you have to stand a considerable distance away from the subject to get a full body shot. I primarily take pictures of people at conventions and it does pose a problem with an 85mm prime, but if you want amazing portraits without breaking the bank this is the lens for you. I was skeptical at first about using a manual lens, but after figuring out the aperture ring, focus zoom, and the focus peaking I feel as though I'm not losing any time by not having autofocus.

Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included).

I received this yesterday to use in my business.  My husband tried to install it on our wifi at the shop.  He got it to the point of inserting the sd card.  Everything seemed to be fine.  We were still connected with the cord to the router and it worked.  Then he tries to put the SD card in.  I don't think he's use to working with the smaller sd cards and had a very difficult time putting it in.  He finally got it to read the card, but then the internet connection would go out.  If he took the card out, he would get the internet back.  This went on for a few hours trying to figure this out.  The still shots were what I really bought this camera for.  I'm not going to sit around and watch who comes to the door (inside) 24/7.  I wanted to see who was going in and out of my shop or if my boxes as been picked up and so forth.  He never could seem to get the sd card to work AND the internet connection.  Really strange.<br /><br />Fast foward..... it is the next morning and I decided to try from scratch to install this camera in my home.  I figure my husband must have been doing something wrong.  We are not amateurs with electronic devices and I really couldn't figure out why he was having such difficulty over at my shop.  I plugged in the ac adapter to an outlet and then plugged the ethernet cord into my router.  The vimtag is on because of the red light on the right side.  But it is not even connecting to my internet here at the house at all.  No green lights.... nothing.  I've waited about 3 minutes inbetween tries and nothing.<br /><br />So needless to say I am VERY disappointed with this product.  Not sure if we just got a defective one or not, but I find it really, really strange that both my husband (over at my shop) and myself here at home cannot get this thing to work for various reasons.  Like I said before, this is not our first rodeo with electronic devices but after a quick call to the company, I plan on returning this product.  Does anyone know of another similar product for us to try.  We really need the still shots to be captures but I'm not seeing that features on any of the other cameras like this.","2015-08-31"],["US",17163373,"R26A01HTD5USBY","B004RBX0GO",313596648,"Ravelli APGL5 Professional 65\" Ball Head Camera Video Photo Tripod with Quick Release Plate and Carry Bag","Camera",3,0,0,"N","Y","Not very quick to use.

They in return sent me a complimentary upgrade to this version which is 100x better. They got rid of the ball twists and replaced them with quick using clamps. It's extremely sturdy! You can confidently place your camera on it at any height and terrain. You still have to take parts of it apart to pack it up but the functionality of it and sturdiness compensate for the little bit of putting together of it you need to do.

You're pretty close.  One of the most important features of a 'security camera&#34; is the ability to detect motion and record, especially when running on battery and limited storage space.  I tested the motion detect on this camera in a few different environments so far (i.e. low light, indoors, outdoors, etc..) and all I got was a SD card full of video triggers.  All the testing was done with the low motion sensitivity setting.  I can't even imagine what the high one would be.<br />As others said, the low light operation is poor.  I did one of my tests outdoors as the sun was setting.  It was good until a point - then the camera started having seizures..it got fuzzy, went to black and white...back to color...then ultimately stabilized with lines across the screen.<br />Another oddity I noticed was that the firmware reported in the windows config tool seemed later than the latest version posed on the Zetta site.  I'm not exactly sure why that is.<br /><br />It gets two stars because there was one time, in a very light controlled indoor environment, where it didn't constantly trigger, so it MAY have some usefulness for your particular situation.  In adequate light, the video isn't too bad (you don't need HD for most security applications).<br /><br />The are a variety of settings that are configurable, which is quite nice.  One setting that could, and should, be configurable is the amount of time it will record after the last trigger is detected.  The manual states that this is 5 minutes.  So, if someone enters the picture for 30 seconds then leaves, you conceivably would have 5 minutes of recording nothing afterwards.  This isn't power or memory efficient.<br /><br />My original thought was to return this, but I want to crack it open and look at some of the internals.  I may decide to make my own.<br /><br />I will continue to test and report any new developments.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>47348933</td><td>R1KWKSF21PO6HO</td><td>B006ZN4U34</td><td>789352955</td><td>Celestron UpClose G2 10x25 Monocular, Black (71213)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Exactly what I wanted and expected.</td><td>Exactly what I wanted and expected.

Upon opening the packaging it comes with a pack of paper, and a pain charging cable.  On the plus side it comes fully charged and ready to print<br /><br />I went to load the paper into the printer, and there are warnings about not to bend the paper, leave it in the car, standard stuff.  Loading the printer was as easy as sliding the top off, and dropping the pack barcode down in the printer.  Getting the top back on required a few flips to find the right direction since it doesn't clearly line up which side the top slides back on from.<br /><br />Note that the 2x3 print size is actually very small.  This should be obvious by the sizing, but make sure you understand what you are buying.  These aren't normal 3x5 photos even.<br /><br />My first attempt to print was using a non rooted android one plus one running lollipop(oxygen OS).  I went to the app store and downloaded the Zink app.  For some reason the app caused my phone to work very hard and heat up, I haven't had issues with other apps doing this.  One thing I did notice while using the app was NFC options.  Which is neat you just put your phone on the printer and it loads up the app for you, very convenient and a nice touch.<br /><br />While using the app it crashed several times on initial launch.  I tried to bluetooth pair the printer outside of the app and after a few attempts I was able to get it to pair.  However I was unable to print from the app with pairing the printer from the standard android bluetooth menu. I deleted the pairing and initiated the pair from within the app, this time it worked.<br /><br />When I finally got the printer working it popped up telling me there was a critical firmware update for the printer.  I let it download and apply the update via bluetooth.  It took about 5 minutes to update, and the instructions said to wait for the printer to restart.  The printer never restarted and required a power on, but the update worked successfully.<br /><br />I did find quite a few issues with the app.  The estimated percentage complete for sending to printer / printing was wildly inaccurate.  I received several out of memory errors when trying to load larger pictures.<br /><br />I also tried the same setup from an iPhone 6.  I downloaded the app, but was not given an option to pair bluetooth from within the app.  I did it from the system menu and it worked fine.  I didn't experience any crashes with smaller pictures.  The percentage completion bar was also more accurate.<br /><br />Printing take approximately 40 seconds to send to printer, and another 35 seconds to print.  While the printer is printing, it is pretty quiet.  It does have a bit of a high pitch tone to it, which could get annoying to some people.  The first print takes a bit longer since it &#34;prints&#34; the barcode you use when loading the printer.<br /><br />As for the quality of the prints, I used very high resolution DSLR pictures to try to pull the best photos possible from the little printer.  I noticed the colors are slightly muted, and the picture overall a bit darker.  Contrast was fairly low and there was a brownish tint to the photos, which almost looked like the standard instagram filter.  There was discoloring around the edges, and darker parts of photos were crushed into black. Some of the patterns such as on shirts, or with strands of hair remained, but gradual transitions looked muddy and unable to differentiate.<br /><br />The resolution was OK for the size of the photo.  They look fine from 1-2ft away.  Some of the photos I printed I aimed to capitalize on the look of the prints, including a nearly black and white photo of a flower.  These turned out really well.  While printing photos straight from the iPhone / One Plus One's camera resulted in even more muddying and lack of definition.<br /><br />I was not able to smudge the images after printing, and the printer didn't seem to get too hot.  Based on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.  There is an auto power off setting, but it seems the actual printing takes the majority of the battery.<br /><br />The prints end up being very expensive with the proprietary paper you have to buy.  Instead of making money on ink/film/the device, they are clearly aiming to make the profit on the paper.  Also note that I was provided a sample of this product for my unbiased review.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />Pros:<br />* Cool concept<br />* Makes stickers<br />* Decent battery life<br />* Fairly quick printing<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The quality of prints are low<br />* Android app needs work<br />* Very expensive per print<br />* Very small print size.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say this printer would be neat to print a quick sticker to put on something.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>34584405</td><td>RK6ZADB3W80HN</td><td>B001NY1UJM</td><td>14533641</td><td>CowboyStudio 220 Watt Photography Studio Monolight Flash Lighting Kit - 2 Studio Flash/Strobe</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Love it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>16186864</td><td>R2JF6AADBJXWPS</td><td>B002VPE1WK</td><td>839407277</td><td>AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR/DSLR Cameras and Accessories - Black</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great Case!</td><td>This case was a nice upgrade from my old bag.

No it's not the lightest mini tripod in the market but it's sturdy as anything.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>45430663</td><td>R3FZ2O4QUYHKQ1</td><td>B007VGGIB6</td><td>170089990</td><td>Nikon WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter for Nikon Digital SLRs</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Otherwise it's awesome!</td><td>When I used this, it completely drained a newly charged camera battery in 3 hours.

Packed inside the box is the USB microscope, stand, USB cable, an installation software (CD) a manual, a quick start guide, and calibration chart.  However, if you do not have a CD&#60; you can get the manual and software online.  Assembly was easy and intuitive, taking about one minute.  The software installed on my Dell Windows 7 system with no issues.<br /><br />Simply plug the microscope into the computer and you are off and running.  The software of course interfaces with the computer and does so exceedingly well.  You can even open the interface software to a full window. To view objects, one knob provides general control and the other provides fine tuning.  This is perhaps where a more expensive unit might be better suited for some.  The fine tuning takes effort.  A variable light adjustment is provided on the cable, as well as a trigger/shutter control for the camera. The shutter button works very well and the software provides a means of organizing your images.  It is important to remember that there is no viewing piece on the microscope.  Instead, you view images on your computer.  Magnification, up to 330x, is controlled through the software.<br /><br />The general design of the microscope is good for the intended purpose.  The base is heavy enough and seems secure.  Enough control points are provided, allowing you to hold down slides.  Note-  I was provided a sample for a no obligation review.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>38748540</td><td>R1IC3EUE1F8WAH</td><td>B00US4QCWS</td><td>999932975</td><td>Grizzly Camera Bean Bag (MEDIUM-DARK BROWN), Photography & Video Bean Bag, Camera Support, Camera Sandbag, Spotting Scope Support, Birders Bean Bag, Tripod, African Safari, Photography Tours.</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>bag +5.

The camera itself is good, but I think the app is buggy.  It tends to just sit there and churn when I click on my camera to view it. There is a 2-3 sec delay on the video, which is okay, but sometimes the app freezes, so it doesn't show the correct picture.  However, you can turn the mic on and listen to what is happening?  But what good is that.  You have to manually turn of event recording while you are home, or else you get videos of you and your family doing your normal routines.  The free 1-day cloud storage is good, and most products don't have that.  Quality of the picture is very good whether day or night.  However, if you leave it on auto, it will probably be on night vision (black/white) when not home, as not enough lighting. I have to set it to off during the day, so I can see in color.  Alerts are very good, and spot on.  But I would only use that when away from your house, or else you will get a lot of phone alerts, unless you turn off event recording or the mobile alerts.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the phone app.  You can pan/tilt, but it's not a continuous movement, almost in frames, if that makes sense.  You can also manually set to record, but haven't checked to see how long it will run.  Overall good product, just wish they would fix the app issues, because those get frustrating.  Considering sending back and getting something else, but can't seem to find something better in the same price range with free cloud storage.  So really, really hoping they fix the app issues :)</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52801489</td><td>R175BRS6TYJWAW</td><td>B004GK3TBC</td><td>842561002</td><td>Halcyon Panasonic DMW-BMB9 BMB9 1500mAh 5 Year Warranty Replacement Panasonic Lithium Li-on Digital Camera Battery</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Fits My Lumix DMC-FZ70</td><td>When I bought my Panasonic LUMIX Dmc-FZ70, I knew I'd need a spare battery, but I wasn't sure that this would fit, especially since my particular model isn't listed on the product page.

One downside I did notice is that there is not a native app for the iPad. Because of this I ended up downloading the iPhone version of the app to my iPad and set it up that way. It would be nice if Kodak would make the app universal so that it wasn't so ugly on the iPad. This was my only complaint with the setup process.<br /><br />Using the camera for daily use is a breeze. The video quality is excellent and the pan/tilt feature allows you to see an entire room easily. The app also works well and allows you to set up notifications to alert you if motion is detected. This ensures that you will not miss anything moving in the room that you have the camera setup in. The app also gives you the ability to speak through a speaker that is on the camera, so if you have a pet you could easily speak to them remotely.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this camera is an excellent option for anyone that is looking for a home security camera. The quality is excellent and while the app is not the greatest, it does do its job well enough.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>34839788</td><td>R2OM6OYRFC1EX5</td><td>B000BNY64C</td><td>853708552</td><td>STK's Canon BP-511 2200mAh Battery for Select Canon Cameras (2 Pack)</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Spam</td><td>Buyer Beware: After purchasing this, I begun getting spam email from SterlingTek.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>221141</td><td>R18P3RW2HBRI5L</td><td>B00L2GJBOW</td><td>795532479</td><td>Spy Pen Video Camera Audio Recorder By U-Guard Security Prod</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Grest product</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>50923817</td><td>RDJN88ERJ3H04</td><td>B00HV4XHX0</td><td>629357110</td><td>[2 PACK] Long Camera / Camcorder Neck Shoulder Straps Belt - Length Approximately 36\" + Cleaning Cloth in Retail Packaging (Multi-Color (Blue) + Black)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Fast and accurate; just as advertised.</td><td>Being a larger than average photographer, I was having a hard time finding a long enough strap so my camera would hang comfortably.

The cap does come off easily.....maybe a little too easily for me.  I could see it getting lost pretty quickly.<br /><br />I can get similar effect on photos using free editing software.

I would recommend waiting for something better.

The only thing to watch for is that in wind you can hear the wrist strap wiggling back and forth in the video.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1346699</td><td>R2O5E3WIWVRXUG</td><td>B004W86GQS</td><td>122961982</td><td>Lowpricenice Car Alarm Remote Keychain DVR Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Good qualities and a great seller.</td><td>Good qualities and a great seller.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>126368</td><td>R25GH5G6BIZCDQ</td><td>B00H3R8SEI</td><td>305640860</td><td>LimoStudio 6 PCS Black Nylon Muslin / Paper Photo Backdrop Background Clamps, 3.75 inch, AGG1242</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>Great can b used for number of things.Thx very much.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>29010243</td><td>R34INO3ZYOK8AN</td><td>B00EB6FNDI</td><td>132679409</td><td>ANRAN 2.0 MegaPixel SONY HD Onvif Wireless Wifi Network IP Surveillance CCTV Surveillance Home Video Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Very good for the price</td><td>Pros<br />Very good picture night and day the Sony sencer is very good.<br />A non intrusive size for along an outside sofit.<br />All in all i purchased a second and i am happy with both so far.<br />I use Blueiris for the montoring them and several other brands.<br />Cons<br />The software to change the IP, password, and port not easy.<br />The first unit was tuff to get going but the second came a little easyer.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>35732278</td><td>RWQXENYX7G3XE</td><td>B00TOXJA4G</td><td>488749471</td><td>MeFOTO  SideKick 360 Plus Smartphone Adapter</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>really great.</td><td>Super awesome and sturdy.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>609590</td><td>R17RBEDFH3O5V0</td><td>B0111RCZXU</td><td>564833420</td><td>[Fujifilm instax Mini Case]--CAIUL First Generation Zipper Universal Carry Case Bag For Instax Mini 7s 8 25 50s 90 Camera, Polaroid ZIP Mobile Printer w/ZINK Zero Ink Printing, Instax Printer</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Cute!</td><td>Great color and size.

Living in crime-ridden South Africa and having been the victim of armed house robbery myself, I just had to get a back-up system for my existing system (passive infrared radio- alarm linked to response company) to give additional peace of mind. Eventually I resorted to a Chinese GSM system but if you have ever tried that out you will know the term ' user unfriendly' was specifically created to decribe those systems. In came Korner and what a pleasant experience!<br />A few remarks:<br />One piece door contacts and real pleasing on the eye!<br />Absolutely user friendly - even a child can install them.<br />Direct control via an App on your phone.<br />Long battery life<br />The whole system is plug and  play.<br />Korner will send you an email as well as a pop-up on your phone if intrusion is detected.<br />Korner can be used as a door chime if not armed - so you can still monitor movement through the house even when it is disarmed.<br />Allthough the tags are meant to be used with doors/windows, I've dropped one in portable safebox at home and it works perfectly well to register movement of the box.<br />Very nice feature is that you can actually set up a circle of friends to be notified of intrusions - one can create your own personal neighbourhood watch system.<br />Customer service is excellent - I had a few questions/issues and time and again I was assisted in a prompt and efficient manner. Love the fact that the system is updated continiously (OTA) with new features and improvements.<br />The whole system is portable - so you can take it along if you move.<br />It deserves a 5/5.<br />Francois, South Africa</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>7234871</td><td>R2CMHWXJSV4YXI</td><td>B0088P5QOO</td><td>290684842</td><td>Progo Battery Pocket Rapid Travel Charger With Car & European Adapter for Sony NP-BG1, NP-FG1.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry. I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty. Please see the link below for the DVRs we offer at this time.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: http://defender-usa.com/products/DVRs.eng-12.html<br />9:39 AM Kristi: I can also offer coupon code CXB17, valid until September 30th, for a discount on most regular priced items on our site.<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: How much of a discount does the coupon code provide?<br />9:40 AM Kristi: 10%<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you how frustrated I am that a product I spent hundreds of dollars on and lots of time installing has broken and cannot be repaired just outside of one year.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: I have receipts for having the system professionally installed, which cost over $300.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: That is on top of the DVR system itself.<br />9:41 AM Kristi: I do apologize, William. What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website? There is an 8 Channel DVR with a 500 GB hard drive for $74.99.<br />9:49 AM Kristi: We are unable to offer a larger discount then 10%, regrettably.<br />9:50 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you that it is also frustrating that defender offers a telephone support line that, after dialing extensions for 15 minutes, merely re-routes you to the website.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52432830</td><td>R2KLKFHPR9GM6L</td><td>B00KLTG2J8</td><td>833529558</td><td>Liquid Image 305G XSC-Xtreme Sport Cams LIC Hydra Series 12MP Mask Waterproof Video Camera with 1-Inch LCD</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great fun recording waves and surf</td><td>Great fun recording waves and surf.

Too bad, I really, really wanted this device to be the answer to an otherwise expensive prayer.  I got this for my husband who has been looking at the GoPro devices.  I didn't want him spending $300-400 on a 'toy' so I picked this one out for him.  It seems like a great idea: inexpensive action camera with GoPro mounting compatibility and lots of accessories as well.<br /><br />We got it and he put it on his motorcycle to get some video of his daily commute and travels.  It appears to have worked well for about 25 miles, then the video went wacky; in and out of focus, strange colors (it was shot at night, since that's when he goes to work), so something happened while it was mounted on the bike.  The next morning he shot his ride home during daylight and it became evident what happened: the IR pass filter had come loose and was wiggling about in the housing, causing color and focus issues.<br /><br />Too bad.  We did find the 'entry' level [[ASIN:B00NIYNUXO GoPro HERO (No Wi-Fi)]]and we'll give that a try next, but this one had to go back!  :(  Other than that, this really seemed like a great little unit with features that GoPro has for $300.  Great quality case and the wifi funtionality worked great.  The colors and pictures seemed high quality (until it went south, of course)  If one or the other of these Asian companies would institute a higher level of quality control, they could really rule the action cam market.

We first got the older version of this because it was $20 cheaper. It took 2 hours to figure out how to hook it up to the wifi. Then, when we tried to download the app on our phones, it said it didn't work with the older model. We returned it for this plug and play. You literally just scan the QR Code and within 5 minutes the whole thing is set up and works with the app. Image is fantastic and night vision looks great too. Tons of features that we probably won't even use, but good to have. Also has a mic and speaker so you can hear your baby and talk to them. You can set the volume in the app so that the alarm is more or less sensitive to sound. Highly recommend, especially for under $80!  Update: Feb 2017: Camera has had a lot of glitches over the 1.5yrs we've had it, including disconnecting from the wifi on a regular basis.

This charger by Indie Camera Gear seems to charge just as fast as my Canon charger, and I love how compact it is so it doesn't take up extra outlets when plugged into the wall! It has a red light that comes on when charging and it turns green when it is fully-charged. This charger also has overcharging protection, meaning that you can leave it plugged in overnight and it won't fry your battery! Considering a replacement 70D Canon battery runs about $60, it is VERY nice to have that extra protection! I actually missed that there would be a car charging cable included when I ordered this, so I was thrilled to find that cable in the box! I take a crazy number of photographs every day and one thing I'm not so good about is remembering to stop and charge the battery! This is extra cable plugs directly into the charger and allows you to charge your battery while you are on the go! I love having a car charger for vacations as well because how often do you remember, or have time to charge your camera battery at the hotel? I purchased this charger during a limited promotional period at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for either a back-up or a replacement charger!

Heads up if you're using this on a Canon 5DMark2! On the newer 5DMark3 the issues are resolved.<br /><br />What I could not get past was battery power usage. I have never had a flash unit that would eat up through batteries so fast!  Some users complained about the unit wasting battery power when off. I did not test that so I can't say for sure. But under normal use, the same use as my old 560III's or the newer 560IV's, these things were abysmal! During a wedding, I'd be busy changing batteries all night long! Never an issue with the aforementioned units, which I'm still successfully using.<br /><br />Also, the firmware upgrade can ONLY be done on a Windows 32bit operating system. Insane! I don't even have access to a &#34;32bit&#34; Windows OS anymore!<br /><br />Otherwise, the design, menus, etc are great. Everything else worked and quite well. I shoot in Manual all the time so TTL is pretty useless to me but it worked well when tested. HSS also worked well. It's a new product. I'm sure subsequent versions will have these issues fixed. When they fix them, this flash will be a great thing to have!<br /><br />Sent them back.

It has rounded corners and a big screen, making the camera look good.  But I have concluded that In spite of increasing the optical zoom range, and increasing the imager from 12 to 16 megapixels, the 340HS is not as good a camera as it's predecessor, the 330HS.  I own both.<br /><br />The 330HS has the Digic5 processor, which is faster and allows the use of 3200 and 6400 ISO speeds with some loss of color quality but not horrible colored snow.  The 340HS has the older Digic4 processor which is capped at ISO 3200, and cannot take full images at the burst speed that the 330HS will do.  While increasing the optical zoom the designers reduced the maximum aperture from f3.0 to f3.6.  In low light you have the triple disadvantages of a slower lens, a less-capable processor, and more pixels crowded on an imager of the same size.<br /><br />But the worst part is that many of the manual features available on the 330HS are not present on the 340HS.  One that I miss is forced flash, such as you might want to use when your subject is backlighted by a window.  The camera also displays a ridiculous set of altered photos, including monochrome, of every photo you take.<br /><br />My 330HS connects wirelessly to my computer but I've been unable to get the 340HS to do so in spite of reading the manual and using Canon's wifi connection software.  I've read that others have made the connection successfully.<br /><br />The 340HS appears to be a triumph of style over substance.  Canon can do better.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>910761</td><td>R37DV5UDLQBO52</td><td>B004GGDNNA</td><td>4782757</td><td>ONA The Roma Camera Insert and Bag Organizer - Black</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Very versatile piece of gear.

While the footage does record, I am unable to access the card from PC including after unmounting from the camera setting. I am always asked to format it on my PC. I've tried three different computers and four memory sticks. It seems now the only way to get footage off is by clicking 'download' through the web interface and waiting in real-time for the footage to transfer. The interface is still just as horrendous and unusable as it was when I wrote my initial review so long ago.  The camera quality is acceptable but nothing out of the ordinary these days (it is comparable to the 808 #16 keychain camera, if that). It was easy enough to connect (you have to use physical LAN cable at first) but the built-in WiFi is weak and I found difficulty getting steady signal when it was placed one floor below while the rest of my WiFi-enabled devices worked fine. My biggest gripe is the horrendous interface they force upon you when accessing the camera through the web interface. First you are prompted to install some very cryptic and unknown proprietary plugin / ActiveX control that links to the &#34;Shenzhm Mining Technology&#34; website, which I guess is an affiliation of the developer of this camera. To get motion recording to work you have to enable the alarm action as well (which bombards your phone with notifactions with each motion until you disable notifications via the phone settings), and you cannot use the scheduler if using motion detection. I have set this up to point outside but had to then buy a mechanical timer to power the camera off at night and on in the day since there is no way to remotely power it off or schedule motion recording for only a particular period of time. When you want to see what has been recorded through the Web interface, you go to the &#34;Messages&#34; screen where each record appears twice (once for 'alarm motion' and oncefor 'record'). Only 30 rows are shown at a time and the thumbnail snapshots are microscopic at 80x40 pixels. You can view a larger snapshot by clicking the thumbnail but can only view one snapshot at a time and have to close it to open another instead of just having a prev/next button. The videos have no controls for playback and there is no natural way to download them from the device without taking the MicroSD card out. When you want to see more records you have to endlessly click &#34;More30Records&#34; which is a terrible UX design. I have taken to the extreme of manually modifying styles and local script behavior via Stylish and GreaseMonkey plugins to make the interface slightly more bearable. If you know the device's IP you can connect locally, connecting through their own site for viewing was very sluggish. Next time around I would spend a little more money for a more industry-standard IP camera.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>41904797</td><td>R3K6DWMY9H76R2</td><td>B0036UTQLK</td><td>496402066</td><td>ePhoto VL9026S3 3000 Watt Continuous Light Kit with Carrying Bag with 3 each of 6.5 Foot Tripod, 22x28-Inches Softboxes and Light Heads with 15 45W 5500k CFL Bulbs</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>good backdrop lights are okay--- wish I would have got ...</td><td>good backdrop<br />lights are okay---  wish  I would have got the LED-  screwing 5 bulbs into 3 bases makes them NOT really portable--- GO LED</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13734848</td><td>R9JKLEV5CHZO9</td><td>B010LSAYMY</td><td>634765335</td><td>GeekPro Pro 1 Wifi 12MP Full HD 1080P Sports Camera Waterproof Action DV 170° Wide Helmet Camcorder DVR Sport Camera Action Camera DV Camcorder</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Very good quality.

The seller sold it from Singapore without disclosing it, so I didn't have warranty coverage in the U.S., but Amazon refunded me. There weren't any others of the same model available by that point, so I don't know for sure whether my issue was a one-off. But I sure hope so! ---  In replacing a Canon that cost just $70 over two years ago ([[ASIN:B004HW73S4 Canon Powershot A1200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom (Black)]]), I didn't have very demanding needs: I wanted a better zoom and USB charging instead of AA batteries, and similar or better picture quality. This Samsung made a good first impression but didn't live up to that standard.  It starts by turning on super-quickly, a revelation compared to my old Canon. But looks were deceiving -- you can't actually take a picture for the first few seconds after it comes on. The zoom pops out and the screen lights up, but if you press the button to take the picture, it gives you nothing. You have to release, wait a few seconds, then try again. Utterly infuriating when you've whipped out the camera to try and quickly shoot something before it's gone.  The picture quality also ranges wildly, from decent to unacceptable. A large number of pictures come out unfocused, and no adjustments changed that view from being a complete blur. At other times, colors come out fine at one second and unnatural the next, as in the examples. (White cars on a sunny day were particularly susceptible to being badly washed out.) Most of the time the camera's screen is clear enough to let you know that you have a bad picture and should try again; others no.  The camera isn't without merits. The zoom is great for such a compact camera, the WiFi was a nice feature, and the battery seems to have a pretty long life. But I can't count on it to take an adequate picture, to the point that on a recent trip I ended up ditching it into my backpack and settling for my phone. I'd figured that reliably taking okay pictures was a given even at a fairly low price, but apparently that's no longer the case. I'll be buying something higher-end.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>23176447</td><td>R151GMT74SSHDU</td><td>B00004ZCJJ</td><td>642633790</td><td>TiffenUV Protection Filter</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Tiffen FIlter</td><td>As expected</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>42047070</td><td>R1FXZT47C1YZ4J</td><td>B008515KOM</td><td>736730522</td><td>BM Premium NB-7L Battery For Canon PowerShot G10 G11 G12 SX30 IS Digital Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great battery life.</td><td>Bought this for my new Canon camera.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>11736306</td><td>R1MIRDB9OBMM3I</td><td>B00007EDZG</td><td>479032842</td><td>Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>works well</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1609987</td><td>R29LIXAK3E6M1F</td><td>B00Y1ZCQCK</td><td>498684526</td><td>Accessories for Gopro Monopod Tripod & Float Bobber & Chest Belt Strap Suit for GoPro Hero 3+/3/2/1 SJ4000 Xiaomi Yi Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>fast shipping will do more business</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52977496</td><td>R18SPO7W3DVN43</td><td>B00H3Q8QB4</td><td>826842790</td><td>Foscam FI9821P Plug & Play 1.0 Megapixel 1280 x 720 Wireless/Wired Pan/tilt IP Camera with IR-Cut</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>SUCCESS!</td><td>I had a hard time setting it up but Vincent from Technical support walked me through the setup and got it working.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>25013619</td><td>R3PHJP3QAPWLVA</td><td>B00O9S08Z6</td><td>85219147</td><td>Neewer VK750 II Pro i-TTL Auto-Focus Flash for Nikon DSLR Camera Deluxe Kit with Accessories (10 Items)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Just as advertised.

Lens</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Don't Over Look This Lens</td><td>This is the first lens I bought for my Lumix G1, the reason, having no experience with Lumix lenses, was that Panasonic claimed that this lens was developed by Leica for the M4/3 system.  I have owned this lens for many years now. Frankly, I have not been disappointed.  The lens is impressive as it yields sharp balanced images,  I was not really expecting much at the the time, but it has proven to be a good value.  Since then I have bought many other Lumix and Leica lenses for my G1 and GX7, but I still use this lens frequently.  Last week I decided to give away my entire Nikon system that I used in my profession, a tough decision letting go of and old friend, but I had not really picked it up since I bought this lens. This lens has dampened focusing, or so it seems, and is easy to focus accurately, it is certainly a faster focusing lens than my equivalent Nikkors.  It is light weight.  I carry it in a fishing vest, along with several other lenses. and it gets bounce and banged around when I scurry up and down slopes to get a good position and it has held up well.  In terms of image characteristics it performs similar to my Zeiss lenses on my Hasselblad.  I like to make oversized prints and this lens serves well.  Lumix makes so many good lenses it is hard to know which to buy, I don't regret this purchase.  As a user of may old lenses by Zeiss, Leica and Schneider I would put this lens in the same class. The selection of glass has always been highly subjective relative to one's photographic tastes, so look at some test images to get a feel for the lens.  I really like it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>35033403</td><td>R23SFHD8IAN3UM</td><td>B009F8UE4K</td><td>168397395</td><td>MaximalPower_29</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great</td><td>But unfortunately I had to return the item because I received a new camera for my Birthday</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>50059182</td><td>R3OGW7LMP9L93C</td><td>B004WB8EYM</td><td>386707120</td><td>Neewer IR Wireless Shutter Release Remote Control for Canon EOS 60D 70D 7D Rebel T5i, T4i, T3i, T2i, T1i, XSi, Xti, XT, SL1 / 700D 650D 600D 550D 500D 450D 400D 350D 100D</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>One Star</td><td>Remote does not work for my Canon 60d</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>49523782</td><td>R2GC63EU3MBG0R</td><td>B0116Q3U4Y</td><td>387804619</td><td>Xvim Security Camera System CCTV Surveillance System with 960H DVR 4pcs 900TVL Cameras Outdoor Metal Housing Weatherproof Hard Drive Not Included -100feet Night Vision -IR Cut build in -Quick Remote Access via smart phone</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>(video test and demo) Works awesome, simple to setup compared to other systems</td><td>[[VIDEOID:902e8616169ea6ef371d58868ce0a0e]] ✏️ Quick thoughts to supplement my video demonstration.<br /><br />Everything you need is included except for a monitor (one that accepts either HDMI or VGA) and a hard drive (just a basic laptop hard drive, \\\\\"SATA\\\\\" like this one: [[ASIN:B00AAKF8KC Generic 320 GB 320GB 2.5 Inch Sata Laptop Internal Hard drive 5400 RPM For Laptop/Mac/PS3 (320 GB)]].<br /><br />I like this security system because:<br />- It's very easy to setup. Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included). Click around and right click to \\\\\"go back\\\\\" in the navigation.<br />- Very smooth, excellent quality footage.  Not like that choppy stuff you see on old CCTV security systems.<br />- Tons of long cables. 60 foot cables (8 of them!). Note: Due to the length of the cable, there's a slight 1 second delay from the event to when you see it on your monitor.<br />- Full metal, tough camera design.<br />- Awesome in low-light/darkness. Infrared lights work wonderfully to light up the room when it's dark. (of course the human eye can't see infrared, but it lights up enough for the camera to film everything)<br />- Incredibly good price here on Amazon. Just factor in a hard drive and a monitor.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this camera system. An excellent bang for your buck, especially considering how many cameras they give you.<br /><br />I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration.

The power cable is only about 3 feet long so you have to buy DC power extension cables in order to mount the camera high up on a wall or ceiling. NOTE! you need the 1.3mm x 3.5mm size, that you can buy in various lengths on Amazon.

Although I know this bag was designed to hold a 13 inch laptop you need to take into consideration that it will only hold the laptop without any protective case or cover. In my case I have a 13 inch Macbook Pro non retina and I had to remove the cover in order to use the pocket. And it fit so tight that is kind of difficult to extract the laptop, maybe because the aluminum case of the Macbook Pro is so smooth you can hardly have a good grip. Maybe designers should take the covers size in consideration and leave some room to easily extract the laptop.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52218913</td><td>R1X7GT7V8P6SGS</td><td>B002NWFS8C</td><td>834643585</td><td>STK EN-EL10 Battery Replacement for Nikon Coolpix S3000, S4000, S220, S570, S210, S230, S60, S205, S80, S200, S600, S5100, S520, S700, S500, S510</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Good price-good product-fast delivery.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>46588192</td><td>R2X0Z2LWWB9OXV</td><td>B002W4RPD2</td><td>816625595</td><td>Neewer 58mm 0.45x Wide Angle Lens Macro with Lens Bag for Select Canon Camera Models</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Three Stars</td><td>I'm a cheap butt, and this gizmo got me the shots that I wanted....</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>14978216</td><td>R1RO2FXX4XLZ7H</td><td>B00452V66G</td><td>395224775</td><td>D-Link Indoor/Outdoor Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Three Stars</td><td>Pretty average camera, but it works</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>46223347</td><td>RZY1C7GYXHFZ2</td><td>B005TCJJ9M</td><td>3412128</td><td>Pixel Wired Remote Shutter Release Control compatible with NIKON MC-DC2, for NIKON Nikon D7000 D5100 D5000 D3200 D3100 D90.</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>cheap but great product for my Nikon</td><td>Easy to plug in, this cheap remote shutter release control is one of the best purchases I have ever done.

Had to run all the cat6 wires to where I was going to set up my cameras since these are indoor camera wanted to make sure they did not get wet.  One thing that you must do before installing the camera is to program them to the NVR to make sure they work before you put them up. I suggest doing this first. The instructions are not to clear about doing this. I had to call Amcrest technical support for the NVR. It took a while to get through but they were very helpful and also assisted me setting up my phone app that I downloaded from the Play store. You have to download the right app for whatever phone you are using or it will not work. For the Samsung Galaxy phones I downloaded the  Amcrest view lite app. it work fine so far. Over all for the price these are pretty good cameras I like the option that the can pan and tilt to get a better view of the area. The have a built in speaker which I have not gotten to work with the NVR yet you can also use a Microphone with them still working on that. Write more at a later date when figured out how to make them work.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>3937898</td><td>R2S4WC2QGJ3YIC</td><td>B00P0V0W1Q</td><td>654129912</td><td>niceEshop(TM) Vintage Universal Camera Single Shoulder Sling Belt Strap For SLR DSLR Camera,Black White</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Vert sturdy.

If you are using a GE or Interlogix panel with this model it should be very easy to add to your existing system. Be sure to download your wireless panel's user manual, as you these smoke alarms usually need to go onto a dedicated group/zone, and be setup as a specific sensor. If you are using a monitored Concord 4 system, be sure to add the sensor text as &#34;smoke or fire alarm,&#34; and perhaps a location (which I did not as I don't really care where the fire or smoke is, I just want to know my house is on fire) so that the monitoring company will know that it's a fire emergency and not a police emergency. If you don't name this sensor I believe it will only tell the monitoring company that Sensor #XX has been tripped. I would recommend getting more than one unit for your home, and installing these yourself as it's free. It's definitely simple enough to do by yourself, provided you follow the instructions closely.

The SmaPole F1 Gopro handle is made of a carbon fiber body and metal gopro mount. I think Smatree made a great handle even better by using these materials. I have another brand handle but it's constructed of plastic and foam for the handle. Smatree took it a step further and used a much lighter and stronger material which is great. The SmapPole is longer than my other handle by about 4-5&#34; but this brings the camera further away giving a little bit more distance giving you a wider shot. I do see one thing that many mention, is that it has no grip built in the carbon fiber handle. This is very minor being that they include a detachable wrist lanyard that has an adjustable lock to keep it from sliding off your wrist. For those of you who have a mini tripod, you can screw the end of this handle to extend the height. All in all, I think this is a great product for the price being that it's made of real carbon fiber and all metal construction.

It is very easy to fly.  My 9 year old grandson visited last week and was very good at flying it.  He really enjoyed it.  The DJI website lacks a little.

I set my images up to be jpg at 1024x768 pixels at 96 dpi to make the photos fit perfectly and take up less space on the SD memory card . Also should run smoother that way . Not tried it with varied sizes on the photos .<br />One thing I noticed was on my old digital frame the random mode would never show the same image close together in time . This one in random mode is truly random so some images almost never show . Some pop up almost right after they had already shown . So that was not too appealing . But it has other settings you can try so that does not happen . Like sequential ( right after each other by file name ) . You can also have the images file names pop up on the screen when the particular photo plays .<br />One thing I thought was odd . Is the power button ignored me until I pressed the menu button first . That is a little annoying .  The menu screen looks too ambiguous . But all in all I like it .</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1097565</td><td>R2E689NCPSW3BQ</td><td>B00M6P26WW</td><td>3844715</td><td>YYGIFT(TM) HOT Tiny Smallest Mini Camera Camcorder Web Cam DVR Video DV Hidden Take photo</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>Met my standards.

I use them in the studio so for that purpose they work ok.  If you were taking photos all day long ever day they would most likely not hold up for you.<br />I use them one to two times every few weeks so they work ok.<br />Overview:  For the cost it is a good light use product if you are not going to be doing rapid shooting requiring flashes.  Stand will work as long as they are not going to be used by employees that will not treat them with kit gloves.  If you just need to up your photo quality and don't want to beak the bank these will do.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>47910848</td><td>R2RY8ATUI1OYHY</td><td>B000UPNQCY</td><td>879293303</td><td>Sony NPFM500H Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery Pack for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras - Retail Packaging</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Now he has a second battery and can keep shooting.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>41596451</td><td>R37CB4Y0R4NS65</td><td>B00L3NY180</td><td>61796269</td><td>Canon EOS Rebel T5 DSLR Digital Camera & EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens + 2x telephoto Lens + 58mm Wide Angle Lens + Flash + 59-Inch Tripod + UV Filter Kit + 24GB SDHC card + Accessory Bundle</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>The Camera is so great, like others in the segment</td><td>The Camera is so great, like others in the segment, the accesories kit is fine and usefull but not so well made.

Some accessory kits include one or two items, and you have to buy dozens of different kits in order to get everything that you need. This kit from Baxia Technology literally has everything that you need for your GoPro Camera.<br /><br />First of all, I was overwhelmed by the number of pieces included in this set. I know it states exactly what is included, but wow, when you see it all together, it's a lot of pieces. You immediately wonder will I ever use all of this? And chances are, you won't. But, if you have a GoPro Camera, you will probably use a good portion of it. I waited awhile to write this review because I wanted a chance to truly test each part of this kit before writing the review.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed about this kit was that there are no instructions. None whatsoever. There is nothing labeling the pieces that are included, no booklet showing you how to use the included pieces, and no usage tips or tricks. Basically you are left to figure things out, and if you can't, you are up a creek because there is no documentation, not even a product box to help you. All of these pieces come in a resealable bag, similar to a Ziploc, not very sturdy for the number of pieces included. There is a very nice velvet pouch with a drawstring included that is black and says Baxia on it. I don't know about you, but I hate to be a walking advertisement for companies, so I was disappointed to see their logo on the pouch, especially since it will be holding GoPro Camera accessories, which no one will know or recognize the Baxia name in association with it.<br /><br />Here is what is included:<br />Head belt strap mount<br />Chest belt strap mount<br />Helmet strap mount<br />Extendable handle monopod<br />Floating handle grip<br />Floating block with 3M adhesive pad<br />Wrist strap mount<br />360 degree rotary clip mount<br />Bike handlebar holder mount<br />Adjustable car suction cup mount<br />Three way adjustable pivot arm with surface quick release buckle<br />Three way adjustable pivot arm without surface quick release buckle<br />2 tripod mount adapters<br />2 surface J hook buckles<br />2 surface quick release buckles<br />3 long screw bolts<br />1 short screw bolt<br />2 flat mounts<br />2 arc mounts<br />5 flat 3M adhesive pads<br />5 curved mount adhesive pads<br />Storage pouch<br />Safety buckle<br /><br />The strap mounts are really well made, but they are definitely not one size fits all. I would say they are more like one size fits most. The head belt strap is very comfortable and does not dig in to you as long as you have a relatively normal sized head. If you have a head that's on the larger side, you will find it uncomfortable. The chest belt strap mount is great if you are a size XL or smaller, again, very comfortable, but if you are on the larger side, you'll find the strap uncomfortable. The helmet strap really depends on the helmet. It fit on two bike helmets we tried, but didn't fit a third. It fit on two skateboard helmets, but wouldn't fit a roller blade helmet, and unfortunately it doesn't fit motorcycle helmets. The wrist strap mount will comfortably fit a 7 or 8 inch wrist, but it did not fit comfortably on a plus sized wrist (9&#34; wrist).<br /><br />The straps overall are very comfortable, do not dig into you, and enable you to mount the GoPro Camera securely, so it doesn't feel like it's going to fall.<br /><br />The monopod is one of the best pieces in this kit. Very high quality and extends out like crazy (almost 40&#34;). It holds the GoPro Camera very tightly and securely, and it doesn't feel like the camera is too top heavy even when it's fully extended. It makes it great for capturing scenes that are far away, or when there is a large crowd of people. I have seen monopods alone sell for a little over half the price of this kit, and it's most definitely high quality, and not a cheap plastic monopod like some I have seen.<br /><br />The floating pieces in this kit are the &#34;weak link&#34; in my opinion. The floating handle grip does in fact float, but it's not heavy enough to keep your camera from going for a swim, and getting away from you. The floating block is very disappointing as well, because as soon as it gets fully saturated, it no longer floats on top of the water, but sort of tries to bob just under the surface of the water. The floating handle grip looks so nice, it just is no match for the heavy GoPro Camera.<br /><br />The 360 degree rotary clip mount is awesome, and I mean awesome. The clip on this mount is the most amazing clip that I have ever seen on a camera accessory. It will clip to literally anything and is very durable. The teeth tightly clamp down on the surface that you clipped it to, and it does not cause any kind of damage to the clip. The clip is pretty much unbreakable, I tried clipping it to a variety of different surfaces...plastic, metal, steel, chrome, and it clipped tightly to each surface without any problems or slipping.<br /><br />The bike handlebar holder mount is pretty weak. It fits some bikes that don't have thicker bars, but didn't fit either the mountain bike or road bike that we tried it on. It fit well on the beach cruiser bike though. I was disappointed with the fit of it, and even when there was a good fit, like on the beach cruiser, the mount would slide around and not stay firmly in place. It is one of the weaker mounts in the kit in my opinion.<br /><br />The adjustable car suction cup mount is another awesome product in this kit, for me, the price of this item and the price of the monopod alone make this kit worthwhile. The suction cup is the kind that is tight fitting and it doesn't slide around. It stays firmly on not only car dash boards, but also on the windshield, and on non car surfaces like filing cabinets and counter tops. This is one of my favorite mounts included in this set. It literally attaches to everything. It holds the GoPro Camera so tightly you don't have to worry about things getting out of control while you are using it.<br /><br />The pivot arms are so so. One has a quick release buckle and one doesn't. The quick release buckle to me makes the pivot arm feel &#34;less secure&#34; because I worry about it releasing on it's own. It hasn't yet, but it feels like it could. The pivot arms don't really hold the GoPro Camera tightly. They felt weak compared to the other mounts in this set. The tripod mount adapters are really nice and give extra stability to the GoPro Camera when it's mounted on a tripod. It feels like the GoPro isn't going anywhere, and that's a great feeling.<br /><br />The buckles are very high quality. They don't become &#34;less tight&#34; with continuous use. The J hook buckles are my favorite they feel like they really provide the GoPro the support it needs and won't weaken over time. They are made of really high quality materials and they don't have the whiting or fading that some buckles do with continued use. The quick release buckles, I'm not a fan of, and I've stopped using them, they just don't feel like they stay securely in place to me, no matter what I tried.<br /><br />The screw bolts are very well made, and there are 3 long ones and 1 short one. They are very nice, sturdy, and are not cheap feeling at all. They fit a variety of cameras, not just the GoPro which is nice. They are made of plastic with metal bolts, but it's not really weak plastic and feels substantial.<br /><br />The mounts are extremely well made and durable. They don't bend while in use, or cave in under the weight of the GoPro, something I was worried about when I first saw them. There are two flat mounts and 2 arc mounts, and they are easy to mount and then un-mount using the included 3M adhesives.<br /><br />While I'm talking about the 3M adhesives, most of them were unusable. Because all of the pieces in this kit are just tossed into a bag, the 3M adhesives were bent in the shipping process, and when removed from the bag, some of them no longer had the protective coverings on, some were too bent to use, and some didn't stick at all. Out of the 5 flat adhesive pads, one was sticky enough to use. Out of the 5 curved mount adhesive pads 2 were sticky enough to use. I tried some of those that were bent and no longer felt sticky, but there was no getting them to stick. Getting the 3M adhesive off of the surface once stuck also proved to be challenging and I was happy to have Goo Gone standing by which worked wonders. I would like to see them be no mess adhesives that didn't leave goo behind on your surfaces.<br /><br />At the end of the day, there are some really useful pieces in this kit (the clip, the monopod, and the car mount to name three); there are some pieces that I wish worked better (like the floating pieces); and there are some things that missed the mark all together (the 3M adhesives, the lack of instructions to name two). It's a good kit, but not a great kit. Is it a must have for a GoPro Camera, not really. There are some pieces you will use and a lot of &#34;fluff&#34; pieces that you likely won't use, depending on how you use your GoPro Camera.<br /><br />I was provided with this accessory kit for free in exchange for my honest review.included in this set.

It's about on par with my iPhone ...</td><td>I got this camera as a gift way back in 2007.  Obviously, camera technology has improved a lot over the past couple years, and this camera hasn't really withstood the test of time.  I didn't really need a point and shoot camera back in 2007 so I just kind of stuffed this thing in my closet and forgot about it.  Now, I realized I wanted a cheap point and shoot for taking short videos during my upcoming cruise.  So I busted this out of my closet to see if it still worked.  Luckily, it did.  I've been playing with it for the past few days, and here's what I've observed:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Picture Quality: Shoots decent quality photos/video (I wasn't expecting much, but the picture quality is pretty good.  It's about on par with my iPhone 5.)<br />-Easy to Use: Simple and easy to use (It's bare bones, but all the controls and menus are pretty intuitive.)<br />-Feels Good: The camera feels good in my hand.  It's easy to hold and has a good weight to it.<br />-Tripod Mount: Has a place for a tripod<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Battery Life: It takes 2 AA batteries, which may be a con for some people and may be a pro for others.  However, the batteries don't last very long.  I put in 2 brand new batteries and they died after shooting about 15 minutes of video and taking 3 pictures.  I thought maybe I had used some bad batteries, so I tried again with 2 new ones.  Same thing, died after about 15 minutes of video.  Not sure how many pictures you can take with the battery life though.<br />-Memory Card Placement: The memory card slot is in the same place the batteries are.  So every time you need to change/remove the memory card, you have to finagle around the batteries which fall out easily.  Not a huge deal, but still a slight annoyance.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good camera to just goof around with, maybe give it to a young kid.  I wouldn't use this as your go-to camera, especially if you want to shoot video.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>27825061</td><td>R2BITM4CIQ1Z33</td><td>B00NWXY076</td><td>47021726</td><td>3DR IRIS+ (915) Quadcopter</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Better than all the rest of the quads in the 600 hundred dollar range 10 out of 10</td><td>Read up on this, Phantom needs to watch out as 3DR is in the fast lane and passing all the other quads in the phantom price range.

It has legitimately never let me down in my one year (almost) of ownership and I'll probably order 2 or 3 more in the coming months as my other contour mounts age.  The only issue I can think of is that pairing this with super cheap aftermarket gopro adapter stick things (you know... the little sticks with the bolts through them) requires you to torque the living heck out of the bolts (I keep a multi tool with me anyways... so not a problem for me). But if I use legit gopro equipment or the higher end aftermarket stuff I dont have an issue.  Sticks to my Contour +2 and Roam2 like glue and has survived many a fall.

I first looked at what reviews I could find, such as the couple of reviews on Youtube and a few on Amazon. Since it is such a new camera there is not a lot of info out there, so I was taking a bit of risk.  First thing upon receipt was to connect up my laptop to the camera directly, and get the IP set up and so on. I found that in the current generation of firmware, you are now forced to change the user name and password immediately, a good thing. However what is not made clear is that the firmware will no longer accept a new “weak” password – the new password must be either “medium” or “strong” to be accepted. The error message from the Foscam Client rejecting your new password attempts doesn’t make this clear. A bit of trial and error, and I figured it out.  Next step was to upgrade the firmware. The instructions on the firmware update downloaded from the Foscam site are pretty detailed and clear. System firmware version: 1.11.1.4, App firmware version: 2.74.1.7_p1, Plug-in version: 3.3.0.7. Now time to check out more fully.  The basics worked via the Foscam Client. While I have not had hardware problems with Foscam cams, I have always had problems trying to use their various applications, and so use their camera for the hardware functionality ONLY, and rely on a Synology NAS box running Surveillance Station 7 to talk to the cameras and do the data storage, motion detection, remote access, all outside of the cameras. Surveillance Station and their iOS application DS Cam are both very solid in my experience. Looking to Foscam software to do this functionality is &#34;problematic&#34; to put it kindly - look at the reams of postings over months and years with problems. Give up and look for another solution, don't expect that a firmware update will miraculously solve this.When I tried to add the new FI9900P to Synology Surveillance Station, no luck. From a quick check online I found that this camera is not yet supported in native form by applications such as Blue Iris or Synology Surveillance Station. That is not a surprise for a new camera, and hopefully will be addressed in the days ahead.  Initially I was unable to connect to the camera from Synology SS even as a Generic Camera, using the standard ONVIF protocol. I tried both Synology SS 7, and the open source utility ONVIF Device Manager v2.2.250. I was able to connect up to my FI19831P cameras on the same network on non-default ports no problem via ONVIF, but not the FI9900, so I knew that the problem is the FI9900p camera, not the utility or my network. I talked to Foscam US tech support and they indicated that ONVIF would be implemented in a firmware update in about 1 month (say early October).  I was about to give up, but then today I saw the review by Alex noting that he had got Synology SS to connect to the FI9900P using the ONVIF default port 888, so I changed the ONVIF port back to the default of 888 and gave it a try - success! So it looks like ONVIF support is in fact in place in the FI9900P, but may have some bugs such as currently only working with the default port 888. However that's a good start, and with communications established I can now try out the logging and recording on the Synology SS.  A few more tips / observations:  1) For daylight savings time (DST) you still need to set the offset to 30 so as to get a 60 minute delta in your camera time, not set to 60 like you would expect. This applies to many Foscam (and other China- sourced) current IP cameras. I don't understand the rationale, but at least I can make it work and get the correct time.  2) The HDR video setting seemed to make things worse (picture very dark rather than better, so I left it off.  3) Some of the documentation in the HIKVISION Network Camera User Manual v5.1.0, and downloadable from their site, is quite pertinent to Foscam cameras, and much more detailed and explanatory (such as the explanation around password validity, DST setting, video settings, etc.)  4) for future IP camera acquisition I am going to look more closely at HIKVISION and Dashua as alternatives to Foscam.  Hope this helps others.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>11448821</td><td>R1PDN31H34RZKO</td><td>B00I3J4NG2</td><td>165753185</td><td>DJI Battery for Phantom 2 and Phantom 2 Vision (White)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Very good</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>45107283</td><td>R1B4DLOZ1JS2LA</td><td>B00HJGYGV2</td><td>735764908</td><td>Rec-mounts Picatinny Rail Mount Type1 for Gopro [Rec-b35-s]</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>Love my gadgets thank you</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>49442569</td><td>R1DPO1E6UHH3Z4</td><td>B00MUQER5Q</td><td>38953458</td><td>Action Camera 4K WiFi Camera 16MP WIMIUS Q1 Ultra HD Sports Waterproof Camera Include Waterproof Case</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>very good</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>30643592</td><td>R2A4CE6T3J9ET2</td><td>B00BW6LXHA</td><td>673687626</td><td>Canon SL1 Bundle</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Very good beginners slr camera.

This simple solution helps with that. It attaches around the LCD panel with a simple velcro tab and is removed as easily as it is put on, It does exactly what it's supposed to do; reduce glare and reflections on the LCD panel.<br /><br />Not too much else to say about this.  It's helpful to have, doesn't cost much and works as advertised.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>17065779</td><td>R30JCDPNZNYIDM</td><td>B00H2VSTG2</td><td>747879064</td><td>Dahua IPC-HFW2100CP POE and ONVIF 1.3 MP Network Outdoor Bullet Camera H.264</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Image and construction quality are great!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>19789872</td><td>R2SHCMH5SOM4DB</td><td>B006T7QVJM</td><td>273832307</td><td>Fujifilm FinePix JX500 Digital Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Three Stars</td><td>It is OK for a quick camera</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>3286210</td><td>RCS6IWPIBUYID</td><td>B00W4EKGHW</td><td>18461277</td><td>Nikon D3300 Camera with Nikon 18-55mm VR Lens Al’s Variety Premium Bundle with Deluxe + Tamron 70-300mm Zoom Lens Gadget Bag + 2pc Filter Kit + XIT Wide Angle Lens + XIT Telephoto Lens + Tripod + 32GB Bandwidth Memory Card + 15pc Accessory Bundle Kit</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Very good Camera.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>10434701</td><td>R3H4SNF45PNSJI</td><td>B0007WK8L2</td><td>634625084</td><td>Canon ET-67B Lens Hood for EF-S 60mm f/2.8 Macro USM Digital SLR Lens</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Great!

It was easy to setup and it's easy to use.  I already have a Nest thermostat which I love and I now use the same app (on Android) to manage the camera.  It is really cool to be able to view the camera from my phone wherever I am.  There are some small kinks which seem to need work in the app.  For example, clicking on the notification will open the app and infinitely try to load the image from the camera history.  If you don't pay for the history it was just infinitely load... you could wait an hour it will never load an image.  You have to back out of the app and open it again to see the image.  Also, the camera should come with at least one day or a few hours of video history included for free.  It would be great to have the option to cache video history to my own computer or network device.  Without paying the subscription fee you have ZERO video history.  You will get a notification that the camera detected motion.... but you can't see it because it's usually over before you can open the app.  The camera is pretty much useless without video history... but the prices for history are not cheap.  If you don't mind paying a monthly fee... it's a great device with excellent build quality and image quality.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>38749873</td><td>R3AWK6PWBGTQTQ</td><td>B00V4MMA38</td><td>200747558</td><td>Neewer 3-in-1 Clip-on Lens Kit for Android Tablets,ipad,iphone,Samsung Galaxy and other Smartphones,Included:180 Degree Fisheye Lens+2 in 1 Macro Lens and Wide Angle Lens+Soft Rubber Lens Holder</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Inexpensive bit of fun</td><td>The fisheye lens is the most fun, quite unexpectedly!

This definitely has more attachments and accessories included. All of the stats are very similar as well. It is a complete package with lots of great useful pieces included.<br /><br />You can record video, capture a single photo, capture photo burst, shoot a series of photos of the set interval time, watch video and photo playback adjust camera settings and resolutions and much more. Its quick to pick up even for the not so tech savvy. I count myself in that group. It literally does it all. If you're into filming or shooting photos this is definitely for you. The video is extremely high HD quality.<br /><br />We have really enjoyed learning about this camcorder. We have been testing its abilities. I love that it's versatile. If you can dream it up I guarantee there's a mount out there for it. I'm working on filming my cooking for my blog currently. I'm a chef by trade. I find this camera easy to use and operate by myself. This camera is perfect for a one person operation. Since, I'm cooking, I really like that it's water resistant. Spills happen! It really is a professional quality HD camera. It's amazing to me that it fits in the palm of my hand. This is perfect for using solo you can mount it easily to most anything.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this for everyone. Once you get it you'll think of 1 million reasons to use it. The audience for this camera and equipment is endless. It would make a great gift for anyone. It's not just for sports enthusiast. New parents or grandparents,<br />College-bound students, entrepreneurs, anyone with a YouTube channel, teachers or most everyone would love to receive this as a gift. It definitely fits most budgets. It's the same quality for half the price of the most popular sports camcorder.<br /><br />I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products.

I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty. Please see the link below for the DVRs we offer at this time.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: http://defender-usa.com/products/DVRs.eng-12.html<br />9:39 AM Kristi: I can also offer coupon code CXB17, valid until September 30th, for a discount on most regular priced items on our site.<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: How much of a discount does the coupon code provide?<br />9:40 AM Kristi: 10%<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you how frustrated I am that a product I spent hundreds of dollars on and lots of time installing has broken and cannot be repaired just outside of one year.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: I have receipts for having the system professionally installed, which cost over $300.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: That is on top of the DVR system itself.<br />9:41 AM Kristi: I do apologize, William. What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website? There is an 8 Channel DVR with a 500 GB hard drive for $74.99.<br />9:49 AM Kristi: We are unable to offer a larger discount then 10%, regrettably.<br />9:50 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you that it is also frustrating that defender offers a telephone support line that, after dialing extensions for 15 minutes, merely re-routes you to the website.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>35779328</td><td>R5Q3OI6G75IG4</td><td>B002DW99H8</td><td>431282797</td><td>Case Logic SLRC-206 SLR Camera and 15.4-Inch Laptop Backpack</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>amazing bag, tough and well organised</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>21305461</td><td>R1SZ5NP9MN3WTM</td><td>B005DEHVC8</td><td>830160330</td><td>STK LP-E6 Battery for Canon 5D Mark II III and IV, 70D, 5Ds, 6D, 5Ds, 80D, 7D, 60D, 5Ds R DSLR Cameras BG-E14, BG-E13, BG-E11, BG-E9, BG-E7, BG-E6 Grips</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>All good.

So I still hope it is truly waterproof camera. It is yet to be tested for me. I am not planning to snorkel or dive with it. It tells on the box 15 meters which makes for about 50 feet. Well, I would divide it at least by 3 if not by 5 for true water depth that camera would hold. I don't see any heavy rubber around buttons and when you push button in and there is not protective rubber, there is a crack between the body and the button, I would expect. So I would not expect it to work under water. If it does, Great!<br />I am a fisherman, so I expect just have this camera to work on the river, lake or the ocean surface or above it, and if dropped in the water, not to leak in and spoil the pictures. That would be enough waterproof for me.<br /><br />As many mentioned here flash is weak and making pictures indoors is pretty poor, especially if the picture should have depth or you snapping an object in the somewhat not too bright light from 5-7 yards. Anything closer than 3 yards is more or less ok. And again, that is exactly the purpose I bought it for. Make pictures in close range and outside of the house.<br /><br />My issue mostly with the kit. It is not high quality stuff. But 32 Gb memory card and extra battery set is helping. The belt with floatant that should keep camera floating if it fail to the water was failure. That small thin thread that should be rapped around the camera handle and hold it to floatant got out of the plastic housing right after I pull it out of the plastic rap. I don't think it is seller fault, as all items were in the sealed plastic. Most probably poor manufacturing. The hole in the plastic housing very small. Luckily I have experience working with small parts and have required tools to pool that thread through the small hole in the plastic and tie a little knot on the end of the thread. So all fixed anddone.<br /><br />There is that, my review for now.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>526554</td><td>R2C0H0DOC0EQSZ</td><td>B00W5YHC1E</td><td>139855759</td><td>1000TVL Bullet Security Camera 960H CCTV White Tube 1/3\" VandalProof 72 IR LEDs</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Excellent item</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>36076198</td><td>R2ZZGPLN38LNKJ</td><td>B003TTTFN2</td><td>189429296</td><td>Tamrac 5788 Evolution 8 Photo Digital SLR Camera Sling Backpack (Black) with Lenspens + Accessory Kit Combo for Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Fuji &amp; Sony Alpha Cameras</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Fantastic bag for any trip</td><td>This bag has gone on 3 trips, through all kinds of different weather, and hasn't started to show sign one of wear and tear.

STOP!!!  I had cracked my screen and needed to replace it.  The seller shipped this part quickly and it was in good condition, but it doesn't work properly on my camera.  The manufacturer claims that it fits several different cameras---which it does---and it does fit the HX-300 just fine.  The problem: the LCD doesn't let the light through, so that even though the backlight is working fine and is super bright, when it's all put together it's very dark/dim as if there's no backlight at all.  In fact, I can see the menus and I can see what the lens is capturing, but everything is very faint and hard to see.  I tested it without the backlight plugged in, and it was totally dark, which confirmed that the backlight itself is working, but is not the problem.  I spoke to a camera technician who explained that despite the claim the manufacturers make, this replacement screen is NOT compatible with the camera, electronically.  As a result, it's not working right.  He said the only screen he kneows that is compatible with my camera at this point is a &#34;Sony original replacement screen,&#34; and he steered me to a site that sells genuine Sony replacement parts: https://sony.emcompass.com/item/9596986/Sony/1-811-762-11/Lcd_Module  I purchased the part and it works like a charm.  Unfortunately, I had to pay $80 instead of $20 :-(  (I'm not even going to try to get a refund...)  Note: on the plastic wrap that came with the screen, there was a label with the number S8200 on it.  Could it be that this screen is actually designed to work with the Nikon S8200---which also has a 3&#34; backlit screen?  Note #2: By the way, there is an awesome video on Youtube with great step-by-step instructions on how to remove the old screen and replace it with the new one.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>10002604</td><td>R1XNQ8C8VZ5LZE</td><td>B007TPS9PC</td><td>358790036</td><td>Foscam Wireless Range 9dbi Antenna Expander for Foscam IP Camera - Black</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Works a treat</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>23871436</td><td>RREY335F6NIS2</td><td>B00MNG37C2</td><td>857397110</td><td>Syma X5C 2.4G 6 Axis Gyro HD Camera RC Quadcopter with 2.0MP Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>but great to learn on</td><td>Not as expected, but great to learn on.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>42920584</td><td>R1NBSH81U5FMFI</td><td>B00K8MTQGY</td><td>593898174</td><td>VSGO DSLR Camera Full-Frame Sensor Cleaning Swabs Kits</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>It was gift</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>20271497</td><td>R2PL50KJ19VTJ1</td><td>B00LBS9PZ6</td><td>551038944</td><td>Mudder 5 Inches Tactical Hand Grip Mount Handheld Stabilization Handle Aluminium Alloy (Black) for GoPro Action Video Camera HD HERO2, HERO3, HERO3+</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Fantastic Gopro handle used with Gopro Hero 4 and 3+ ...</td><td>Fantastic Gopro handle used with Gopro Hero 4 and 3+ Black.

I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty. Please see the link below for the DVRs we offer at this time.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: http://defender-usa.com/products/DVRs.eng-12.html<br />9:39 AM Kristi: I can also offer coupon code CXB17, valid until September 30th, for a discount on most regular priced items on our site.<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: How much of a discount does the coupon code provide?<br />9:40 AM Kristi: 10%<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you how frustrated I am that a product I spent hundreds of dollars on and lots of time installing has broken and cannot be repaired just outside of one year.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: I have receipts for having the system professionally installed, which cost over $300.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: That is on top of the DVR system itself.<br />9:41 AM Kristi: I do apologize, William. What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website? There is an 8 Channel DVR with a 500 GB hard drive for $74.99.<br />9:49 AM Kristi: We are unable to offer a larger discount then 10%, regrettably.<br />9:50 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you that it is also frustrating that defender offers a telephone support line that, after dialing extensions for 15 minutes, merely re-routes you to the website.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>34584405</td><td>R1BL90Y3MBW734</td><td>B00O9RTDE4</td><td>79314974</td><td>Neewer PRO i-TTL FlashDeluxe Kit for NIKON DSLR D7100 D7000 D5300 D5200 D5100 D5000 D3200 D3100 D3300 D90 D800 D700 D300 D300S D610, D600, D4 D3S D3X D3 D200 N90S F5 F6 F100 F90 F90X D4S D SLR Camera- Includes: Neewer VK750 II Auto-Focus Flash + Wireless Trigger +N1-Cord & N3-Cord Cables + Hard & Soft Flash Diffuser + Lens Cap Holder</td><td>Camera</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Can not use it for what I wanted</td><td>I got this thinking I could work it with my lights and flash on my camera.

No wires, do drilling, no screwing. It's very affordable and the excellent app puts you in control of the system from anywhere. For a brand new high-tech product it worked surprisingly well straight out of the box. I had a few questions and tech support replied pretty quickly. As it's so new it means it will continue to get even better. Obviously the app can be upgraded as new versions are released, but the hardware's firmware can also be upgraded automatically without you having to do anything.  Korner is so simple that my mother could set it up. It's pretty fun too. Just add a couple of remote CCTV cameras and you'll have an awesome home security system for very little money.  The alarm on the app needs to be much more aggressive to get your attention if one of the tags is triggered, but I'm told they're working on that.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>25135886</td><td>R2GS9UD74QA7L</td><td>B00IPVLFIM</td><td>32693950</td><td>52mm Front Lens Cap for Nikon D3000 D5100 D3100 D3200 D40 D60 with 18-55mm Lens</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>This is exactly like my original and I received it quickly</td><td>I lost my original lens cap somewhere in Yosemite!<br />This is exactly like my original and I received it quickly.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>18883999</td><td>R1E3VXYYB3INE9</td><td>B00XC46RWG</td><td>273550933</td><td>Lightdow LD6000 WiFi 1080P HD Sports Action Camera Bundle with DSP:Novatek NT96655 Chip, 2.0-Inch LTPS LCD, 170° Wide Angle Lens and Bonus Battery</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Disappointed with the video quality but for the money what ...</td><td>Disappointed with the video quality but for the money what would you expect?

It came with a kit that has all the parts you need to utilize this camera the way you'd want. The camera seems fragile but it isn't. Good quality camera that has all the functions. It's so tiny too and has a screen. It has fish eye lens that can zoom 4x. The wifi is cool that you can transfer image to your phone or tablet. It's just an awesome little camera. It's durable though. I played catch with my son and he wore it and the football would smash into the camera and the camera even took a tumble and it still maintained as though nothing happened. The price is super amazing. I got it as a lighting deal and it was a steal of a deal in my opinion. Thanks<br /><br />Now the cons are that there's no instructions manual. I feel like there's a lot more that I should be able to do but can't do it yet. Then again it's fun discovering new things about a device, but a link to instructions would be nice. Also there's so many attachment kits and it's hard to know what is what. A YouTube link showing all the feature would be awesome to solve this. The app could also be better. It's a bit laggy and slow. Maybe that's my device though. The buttons are so hard to figure out sometimes. I have trouble playing back the clip and fast forwarding. Also for some reason it stops recording at certain times. Like it'll record for a minute and stop and start a new clip. Again I feel that all falls on the functionality and instructions would help this. There may be a instruction link that I don't know of. If I do find it I'll use it and come back here to revise this review.<br /><br />Overall I gave this item a 5 star rating and rightfully so. It's a fun device that can be used by anyone for a wide range of things and the best part is that it's very cost effective. Also the quality and functionality of this camera is top notch. My kids have already asked for one for Christmas and I may oblige.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>41194421</td><td>R1RRP40IAHLIFU</td><td>B00RH5REMS</td><td>331701391</td><td>Selfie Stick, Noot® Groupie Self Portrait [Battery Free] Extendable Handled Stick with Adjustable Phone Holder Mount & Built-in Remote Shutter Designed for Apple & Android Smartphones</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Poor quality</td><td>Poor quality.

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry. I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty. Please see the link below for the DVRs we offer at this time.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: http://defender-usa.com/products/DVRs.eng-12.html<br />9:39 AM Kristi: I can also offer coupon code CXB17, valid until September 30th, for a discount on most regular priced items on our site.<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: How much of a discount does the coupon code provide?<br />9:40 AM Kristi: 10%<br />9:40 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you how frustrated I am that a product I spent hundreds of dollars on and lots of time installing has broken and cannot be repaired just outside of one year.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: I have receipts for having the system professionally installed, which cost over $300.<br />9:41 AM William Rooks: That is on top of the DVR system itself.<br />9:41 AM Kristi: I do apologize, William. What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website? There is an 8 Channel DVR with a 500 GB hard drive for $74.99.<br />9:49 AM Kristi: We are unable to offer a larger discount then 10%, regrettably.<br />9:50 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you that it is also frustrating that defender offers a telephone support line that, after dialing extensions for 15 minutes, merely re-routes you to the website.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>41466286</td><td>R19U7UEI5FHKAH</td><td>B00TKLFA6O</td><td>443308689</td><td>OP/TECH USA Utility Sling Duo</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Distribute the weight of a heavy SLR</td><td>This item is exactly what I have been looking for.

Just like the underwater filters, these land filters fit very snugly/securely and your saving $40 when you buy a Three Pack over buying three filters individually. Polar Pro appears to have listened to feedback about their included synthetic tether because all three of my tethers that came with my pack (my Land Three Pack appears to be the newest version due to the Polar Pro's new logo on the storage bags compared to the old logo that was on my Underwater Three Pack storage bags) had their ends singed to prevent unraveling. That's a big plus and it's nice to know Polar Pro is willing to make improvements.<br /><br />The first photo I attached was shot using the Marco lens, with the setting on &#34;Medium&#34; width (Polar Pro recommends this setting with this lens). The second and third photos were shot with the Polarizer lens and in 12MP &#34;Wide&#34; width setting. If you buy both the Land and Underwater Three Pack Lens Filters, you will end up with two Polarizer lens filters. I plan to give the extra Polarizer lens filter to my friend and scuba instructor on Isla Mujeres, Mexico. She will get a ton of use from it!<br /><br />Keep up the great work Polar Pro!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>10147523</td><td>R3V8FKXIHBLWEL</td><td>B009ZM9R4O</td><td>840491020</td><td>Instax Parent</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>91</td><td>108</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>I love this camera</td><td>I love this camera!

This is an outdoor camera. I have it underneath the eve of the house out of direct rain and sun. Nevertheless the screen fogged up a couple of times and never seemed to clear properly. I now have permanent spot on the image where the picture is blurry at night because the night time LEDs are also behind the same clear cover.<br /><br />2.<br /> the camera sometimes stops recording events to the SD card. It was not out of space, and I also had overwrite checked. The only way to fix this was to restart it. There is no remote restart so I have to go and physically unplug it to restart, another poor design non feature.<br /><br />3.<br /> I just reformatted the SD card while it was in the unit (note this is an SD card that has been in there for months recording events)  and once it finished it no longer recognised the SD card. I likely have to take it out and format FAT in my PC to make it work. Yes I did restart it.<br /><br />4.<br /> The biggest fault of all is the fact that I have to use Samsung servers to retrieve recorded events from the SD card. This actually would be ok if it worked. Most of the time it fails to connect or &#34;loses connection&#34; half way through playback. If you are thinking that this is because I have a bad network that is not so. My camera is on a LAN ( I tried wireless and everything was worse when accessing the camera on WiFi) Both inside my home and out on a cell network the camera access is flaky and not reliable at all and is soo slow. Mush of the time the system says the servers are down or are going down for maintenance. This would be ok since its free IF they gave another option for retrieving the event recordings.<br /><br />5. This camera needs a way to directly retrieve the SD recorded events and download them to my PC without using the unreliable Samsung server.<br />Samsung could you please add the  features asked for above.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>9572245</td><td>R2XWJ80REB0ZTD</td><td>B0012XAUV8</td><td>611801529</td><td>Sigma LCF-82 II Accessory 82mm Front Lens Cap</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>As advertised</td><td>As advertised</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>15888332</td><td>R30BFWBQKSCFSM</td><td>B00IOXCG7U</td><td>878210128</td><td>eCost BKP457 Deluxe Camera/Video Padded Backpack for SLR / DSLR Cameras with Microfiber Cloth</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>best product</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>11861025</td><td>R385ARIKM46VX9</td><td>B008MW6Y12</td><td>597683407</td><td>NIX 8 inch Hi-Res Digital Photo Frame with Motion Sensor (X08D)</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Got wife off my back</td><td>Extremely easy to setup.

The key of course is will it last and I will come back in edit to give those of you on the edge of your seats closure.

This shouldn't be used in a semi cloudy day because it messes up the temperature for sun verses shade. This product defiantly needs to be used often before you rely on it for a professional setting. I did find it easier to  use it not as a place of the auto temperature but shoot with it and use it to edit white balance later. That way I could use the control easier to my advantage it it messed up.

The zoom is insane but try keeping your hand steady to get the shot.  The ISO can go into 6400 bit I wouldn't advise it.  In fact, I set the auto default ios to not go above 800.  Noise levels creep into the photos after this.  This camera is heavier than your average point and shoot but not as heavy as my D750.  I would recommend the camera but don't expect miracles.

There seem to be about 10 different camera brands all using the same construct.  The weakness of this product is the firmware and software.  Even the P2P doesn't work very well.  I had to run it 3 times to get both cameras to actually connect.  The browser plugin for the cloud viewer lacks all the usable features of the mobile software.  Sadly, as soon as you leave the WiFi connection with your mobile device, it no longer connects through the web.  You have to switch to port-forwarding and reset your cameras to use a static IP address so it doesn't keep disconnecting.  If you use Port forwarding, P2P no longer works.  Port Forwarding can also corrupt your router settings, particularly if you have more than 1 camera.  It shouldn't be this difficult to use these cameras.  The software should be able to either install these properly without intensive intervention, but that's still a dream at this point.  Documentation is useless.  And forget calling the help line or trying to use the included remote installation card from Foscam.  Average wait time on hold is more than an hour.  Great software / app opportunity here for someone to develop and exploit this weakness.  Bracket design doesn't space camera far enough from wall to allow space for antenna.  Needs to have both adjustable distance from wall and provide at least 1/2 inch more space.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>9731896</td><td>R1FSM3WEHC9RNL</td><td>B0117C8VNC</td><td>869061065</td><td>PicPro Flexible Tripod – Our #1 Flexible Tripod - The Original, Amazingly Lightweight, Portable and Durable, with Flexible Legs, Strong Mount and Compact Design – for Digital Cameras, Smartphones, Video Recorders & DSLR (Black, 10.5 Inches, ¼‘‘ Screw)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Flexible  & Amazingly Lightweight Tripod</td><td>It is well designed and  can position it in just about any way that you need to.

I actually dread using the kit lens now, and have considered just getting rid of it and getting a smaller focal length prime Rokinon to replace it, as this 85mm you have to stand a considerable distance away from the subject to get a full body shot. I primarily take pictures of people at conventions and it does pose a problem with an 85mm prime, but if you want amazing portraits without breaking the bank this is the lens for you. I was skeptical at first about using a manual lens, but after figuring out the aperture ring, focus zoom, and the focus peaking I feel as though I'm not losing any time by not having autofocus. I will be in the market for another smaller focal length lens from Rokinon to add to my photography collection.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>21717524</td><td>RWKFL2ZNAH6OE</td><td>B00TPLRB16</td><td>36294660</td><td>Sabrent EVA Hard Carrying Case Pouch for External 2.5\" Hard Drive (EC-CASE)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Pleased with Sabrent EVA Hard Drive Carrying Case</td><td>I use these small external hard drives to back up certain pictures or files from my computer.

When shooting underwater videos, there will be a really loud noise, like loud &#34;hiss&#34; or other high frequency noise. I don't know if this is caused by our pool, since we only use it in the pool.

I really need the EVF when under water. I can't see the back LED screen showing up in almost any of my cameras when under water. Why don't all the underwater cameras have a EVF! (Or any type of view finder!) Or do I need to invent one? Anyway, this case works great and the secret is to text out the bag before use. Put in some tissue paper etc...and seal it and text it. Before every shoot! If you see bubbles around the bag after a minute or two check it out. Don't keep swimming around.

My camera fell off the windshield due to the suction cup loosening or whatever, I was immediately pissed.  But, I wetted it, and put it back up and have not had an issue since. -The picture is very good and the sound is fine. -I thought the instructions were short and to the point.

Although this lens hood has a filter tread, using either one of the filters I have along with this lens hood would cause heavy vignetting with the lens at its widest angles. That is not really a point against this product, but I think it relevant in that it creates a lot of cases where you can't really use it.<br /><br />As for it's own usability, this lens hood cannot be reversed and it is a bit troublesome to tread this in properly so it is rather awkward to put this on or take it off while you are already out and about taking photos. It does not just snap in like the lens hood that I had with my SEL35f18. I found that the only way to really use it is to put it on my lens before heading out, but it makes it so that I can't put it in my rather small camera bag (the one that went with my camera). In short, I only get to use it when I'm expecting to shoot at something that causes lens flares.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52138075</td><td>R2SS7SNUPF0167</td><td>B005K1Y4I8</td><td>871975389</td><td>DSLR Camera Hand Strap Wrist with Padded Neoprene and Connecting Metal Plate by USA Gear - Works With Canon , Fujifilm , Nikon , Pentax , Sony and More Cameras</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Not great, but OK.</td><td>The Targus version works better, but this one's OK.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>40033984</td><td>R1A3LBJR2JO1J0</td><td>B00005NPW3</td><td>79447456</td><td>Nikon UC-E1 USB Cable for Coolpix 990 Digital Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Ordered for cousin</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>50655309</td><td>R3UTDI5OPFMC61</td><td>B00009UT28</td><td>980148855</td><td>Sunpak 620-020 Tripod</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Just what I was looking for</td><td>Excellent value.

Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included). Click around and right click to \\\\\"go back\\\\\" in the navigation.<br />- Very smooth, excellent quality footage.  Not like that choppy stuff you see on old CCTV security systems.<br />- Tons of long cables. 60 foot cables (8 of them!). Note: Due to the length of the cable, there's a slight 1 second delay from the event to when you see it on your monitor.<br />- Full metal, tough camera design.<br />- Awesome in low-light/darkness. Infrared lights work wonderfully to light up the room when it's dark. (of course the human eye can't see infrared, but it lights up enough for the camera to film everything)<br />- Incredibly good price here on Amazon. Just factor in a hard drive and a monitor.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this camera system. An excellent bang for your buck, especially considering how many cameras they give you.<br /><br />I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration. Hope demonstration and test helps!<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />👍 Yes, absolutely.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>46765277</td><td>R1APH8EIEYSVY7</td><td>B00KE6RQ6Q</td><td>828961889</td><td>AEE Technology Action Cam S71 4K 1080P 16MP Slim Body Wi-Fi Waterproof Wireless Action Camera with 2.0-Inch LCD (Black)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>nice one</td><td>Fast shipping, the camera is very easy to use and comes with so many accessories, the video and pictures came out nice! definitely worth the money...</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>49442569</td><td>R3J8JK60SX976P</td><td>B00KBT0YD8</td><td>812370354</td><td>AFUNTA Head Strap Camera Mount Support For Gopro Hero4 Hero3+ Hero3 Hero2 Original Cameras, Xiaomi Yi, SJ Cameras</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>very good</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4562144</td><td>R283PJIMA427LN</td><td>B0049VMMZ2</td><td>934531573</td><td>Wasabi Power Battery and Charger for Canon BP-827</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Was an excellent purchase.

The Schmidt-Cassegrain design is a fraction of the size of a regular, full-size 6&#34; scope (Dob, for example).  Super portable, but very powerful.  It is great to have such a small scope that performs as well as a much larger one.<br /><br />- Build quality.

I received this yesterday to use in my business.  My husband tried to install it on our wifi at the shop.  He got it to the point of inserting the sd card.  Everything seemed to be fine.  We were still connected with the cord to the router and it worked.  Then he tries to put the SD card in.  I don't think he's use to working with the smaller sd cards and had a very difficult time putting it in.  He finally got it to read the card, but then the internet connection would go out.  If he took the card out, he would get the internet back.  This went on for a few hours trying to figure this out.  The still shots were what I really bought this camera for.  I'm not going to sit around and watch who comes to the door (inside) 24/7.  I wanted to see who was going in and out of my shop or if my boxes as been picked up and so forth.  He never could seem to get the sd card to work AND the internet connection.  Really strange.<br /><br />Fast foward..... it is the next morning and I decided to try from scratch to install this camera in my home.  I figure my husband must have been doing something wrong.  We are not amateurs with electronic devices and I really couldn't figure out why he was having such difficulty over at my shop.  I plugged in the ac adapter to an outlet and then plugged the ethernet cord into my router.  The vimtag is on because of the red light on the right side.  But it is not even connecting to my internet here at the house at all.  No green lights.... nothing.  I've waited about 3 minutes inbetween tries and nothing.<br /><br />So needless to say I am VERY disappointed with this product.  Not sure if we just got a defective one or not, but I find it really, really strange that both my husband (over at my shop) and myself here at home cannot get this thing to work for various reasons.  Like I said before, this is not our first rodeo with electronic devices but after a quick call to the company, I plan on returning this product.  Does anyone know of another similar product for us to try.  We really need the still shots to be captures but I'm not seeing that features on any of the other cameras like this.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>17163373</td><td>R26A01HTD5USBY</td><td>B004RBX0GO</td><td>313596648</td><td>Ravelli APGL5 Professional 65\" Ball Head Camera Video Photo Tripod with Quick Release Plate and Carry Bag</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Not very quick to use.

They in return sent me a complimentary upgrade to this version which is 100x better. They got rid of the ball twists and replaced them with quick using clamps. It's extremely sturdy! You can confidently place your camera on it at any height and terrain. You still have to take parts of it apart to pack it up but the functionality of it and sturdiness compensate for the little bit of putting together of it you need to do. Comes with a great carry bag not to mention their customer service is fabulous so if you ever have an issue you don't have to be afraid of contacting them.

I live at the beach and use my gopro camera around water often so the floaty is a great backup safety measure to keep from losing your camera in the water. I love the pole as well. I just keep my camera attached to it because it's just easier to carry that way. The pole works fine but was a little tricky figuring out how it expands and I've gotten water and sand stuck in it which made it difficult to expand and retract at times. The pole also floats and had an armband so you won't lose the camera.

The forward facing surface of the human body is rarely absolutely perpendicular to the ground.  Consequently, if you simply clip the Narrative Clip to your clothing, there is a good chance that the camera will not be facing directly forward and will instead be tilted at a slight angle.  As a result, you will only rarely obtain photos of what is directly in front of you.  Instead, you will obtain far too many photos of ceilings and trees and disembodied heads, and not nearly enough photos corresponding to what you actually saw in front of you during the course of the day.  I think the concept of the Narrative Clip is sufficiently worthwhile that I will keep on experimenting with different clip positions to see if this design flaw can somehow be overcome, but it's unfortunate that the designers of this product have not provided a solution to this basic problem.","2015-01-03"],["US",15798629,"R2MJYPEBUH2XDR","B00NIYNUF2",985049339,"GoPro CHDH-401 Black","Camera",5,0,1,"N","Y","Five Stars","GREAT","2015-01-03"],["US",42693316,"R3KHM8IHK0QXW8","B00HGLTCSC",2232344,"PiuQ Professional Quick Release Camera Strap [Air Mesh Padded |Underarm Stabilizer] Single Shoulder Sling Belt fits Digital SLR/DSLR Camera, VideoCam","Camera",5,1,1,"N","Y","Five Stars","Works well and has lots of adjustments.

It gets those 3 stars because the zoom capability is amazing.    However, the images are NOT clear.  The lens is cheaply made with spots of dark residue all over the metal and the weld points are horribly concealed.    Lets get to the image quality though, because I know that is what you want to know about.    Shots with this lens are meant to be taken in bright sunlight otherwise your shots will be terrible and you will have to resort to using a super high iso. I had to use 6400 constantly at high noon just to get standard lighting at the full 1000mm zoom.    I use a tripod and a wireless shutter release remote for shot with this and the images still manage to be blurry.    It is manual focus only which isn't bad and that is what I prefer, but even with a remote when you go to take a picture, the motion of the shutter closing is just enough wobble on the tripod to make the image blurry.    I'm past warranty so I can't take it back which sucks.    If you guys wish to contact me I'll supply photos taken with my D3200 using this lens if you wish to get an idea of what the quality actually is because I can't upload on amazon for some reason.

Used the lamp for 250 hours total over those 2 years and its not working any longer.  I paid $109 back then.  So overall not the best  but I feel I got my moneys worth.  if you use your projector a lot 250 hours could go very quickly.  Also to note I did NOT clean my projectors filters  ( I think you are supposed to vacuum the intake) which I guess I should do more often. It seems these thing die from high heat.  I put the projector on the medium setting for brightness then adjusted it recently to the high setting for brightness that is what seemed to kill the bulb. but I  wish i remembered to vacuum the intake filters more often.  Im sure it was a a M-Wave company replacement because I kept the receipt.  They say the company was started in 1989 so I figured If i had to replace the bulb at least they would take it back int eh 150 warranty period.  I did not have to do that but I i did only get 250 hours out of the bulb and only about 3-4 hours at the end if its life on the &#34;high&#34; brightness setting.

Based on reviews, I bought this one.  Here's the deal: the set up instructions are minimalist.  You turn on the device, connect it to wifi, and it provides a code that you enter into a web page to create an account with Nixplay.  So far so good. But how do you get pictures onto it?  It is impossible to figure this out without watching the Nixplay tutorials.  The tutorials are pretty good, but we couldn't find any written version of the instructions. The Quick Start instructions should have had bold letters: WATCH THE TUTORIAL VIDEOS!!!  Would have saved some heartache.<br /><br />The web site was very flaky on a Mac Powerbook (Safari).  We had to use a Chromebook to set up the account and repeatedly reload the Powerbook web page to make it work.  Strange, but eventually it did work.<br /><br />The unit also arrived with a single bad pixel, in the lower left.  It is not noticeable with lighter color photos, but on anything dark it stands out like a beacon.  Very annoying, but not quite worth packing it all up and returning it. Ding two stars for poor QA.<br /><br />All said and done, the thing I like about this is you can email pics to the photo frame (after you configure the email settings on the web site). Shoot on your phone, email, wait a few minutes. Done. That's pretty cool.  Now we have to convert all those old kitchen-counter prints....","2015-01-03"],["US",47850977,"R1AOK7FLX6XJHB","B00CDIDZWM",636445780,"Sony VMC-15MR2 AV Cable for Handycam","Camera",3,0,0,"N","Y","ok","At first I thought that it didn't fit my camcorder, the Sony cx240, but there is an connecting port on the bottom right that it will connect to.

I was used to having to place 2 slides into my scanner and scan, then replace those with 2 more and scan again.  Anyone having done this knows how slow this goes.  I love the fact that I can scan all my slides quickly and not worry about the quality.  The quality of many of my old slides has decreased quite a bit over the years anyway, so after scanning them, I'll choose which ones to try to restore.  Bottom line is this machine was helpful to me for fast scanning and organizing of slides only.

After having this camera installed for 3 weeks the picture went blurry and there is no night vision at all. I did get an e-mail back from Pyle after waiting a week and the told me to set up DDNS just follow the instructions to view the camera remotely or use Ivideon or Ispy which I tried to do but couldn't get it to show my camera. Their instruction manual is not written for a person that doesn't know how to do this.

This seems way overpriced for me, when the book &#34;Poor Man's Picture Gallery&#34; (a beautiful, massive hardcover book with hundreds of stereoscope images, which comes with this exact same OWL viewer) is only $5.00 more.  Also, I just think $30.00 is too much for this viewer.  It is plastic, not very attractive (not ugly, but certainly not something you'd show off like a wood stereoscope), and I found it just didn't work with every stereo card.  Granted, it worked fine on most cards, if you take time to properly adjust it.  But the length it is capable of telescoping for focus is just a few inches, and on some cards there just was no point where the card came into focus for me.  I could tell if it had a little more length to stretch, it would work.  So I feel it's an imperfect viewer.  Another thing is, the tabs that are supposed to hold it together, don't fit well.  I own three of these now (since they come with all Brian May's books) and this is the case with each. They pop right back out.  Also, for me, the viewer never seems to be in focus, it causes back and neck aches in no time, due to the fact that you have to lay it on the image and then lean down to look into it, and is cumbersome to adjust up & down.  Overall, not a very good viewer,  in my humble opinion anyway.  I know that's heresy for many ... to speak ill of a product from the great Brian May.  But seriously - pick up a Loreo paper viewer for $2.95 and use that for viewing images in books.  Or if you want to spend the money, buy a Pokescope.  And Brian - if you're reading this, I'm sorry, and I do love you!","2015-01-03"],["US",1878006,"R3RXLACMNQLYT2","B001CADR0W",656270993,"Nikon SD-9 Hi-Performance Battery Pack for SB-910 and SB-900 and SB-5000 Speedlight Flashes","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Very Useful!","Very useful adjunct to my Nikon SB-900.

The navigation wheel on the battery grip, when used to move the focus point, has started scrolling vertically continuously when pressed. To stop it you have to hit the main body navigation wheel. It's basically useless now.  I first contacted Eachshot, who provided a canned response of not being able to help and saying &#34;All response in accordance with Amazon's policy. For more questions, you can contact Amazon directly.&#34; When I contacted Amazon they directed me to their fraud group (?) when I was asking for a working replacement, because the product is not 6 months old. Amazon said the purchase was over 30 days old and could do nothing (UPDATE: Amazon has finally refunded me the cost of this faulty product). I emailed Meike support and did not receive a response.  Really a lousy all-around experience, from each party involved. I won't purchase a product from Eachshot or Meike again. It's unfortunate that my rating of this product drops from a 5-star to an $85 worthless 1-star.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just received this and wanted to make a few notes for others.  First, it's very easy to install. It doesn't pop in, you turn the &#34;Lock&#34; nob and it pulls itself onto the D750 body. It fits VERY well, no gaps and clearly well designed.  There's the power button specific to the battery grip you must turn on. The main and sub-dials work very well, and the grip texture is excellent. The option wheel/nob is probably the only lacking item on this grip. It's a bit difficult to hit the center (100% viewable) but it's far from a reason not to purchase.  I also want to mention if you want to use the AF-L/AE-L button on the battery grip for other than that option, you must set it separately in camera. I use this button for AF-ON and couldn't figure outwhy the camera body was set for this, but the grip wasn't. Anyhow on the menu this can be found at &#34;Custom Settings Menu -&#62; Controls -&#62; f10 Assign MB-D16 AE-L/AF-L button&#34;, then choose what you would like to use it for.

One for me and one for my wife.  We are both photographers and we primarily shoot Nikon DSLR cameras but like Sony mirrorless cameras because they are light weight and are good backup cameras. Prior to this purchase we were using Sony NEX 5 cameras as our backup cameras but we weren't happy with the limited bracketing capabilities, i.e. 1/3 Fstop with only 3 shots in the bracket set.  That essentially made the cameras worthless for HDR shooting when high dynamic scenes were involved.  Another photographer friend bought one of these and sang its praises to me before Christmas.  I did a lot of research and the 11 frames per second, 25k ISO, view finder and the super auto focus got my attention. We already had Sony E-Mount lenses so I bought two A6000 bodies.<br /><br />So far we are loving these cameras and have already taken several pictures with different light levels. The processed images are beautiful and the onboard stabilization seem to work quite well.  They camera seems to be noise free up to about 3200 ISO.  More testing will be necessary but so far this inexpensive camera is very impressive.  A negative is that they didn't provide a 110/12volt charger.  Because of the low price and many nice features, it appears that Sony cut corners by eliminating the chargers.  We already had ours from our NEX 5 cameras so it isn't a big deal.  That brings up another nice benefit.  This camera uses the same batteries as the NEX 5 cameras. As for charging, they do provide a USB charging cable that requires charging to be done with the battery in the camera. This is a slow process but it works.  If you by this camera, I suggest you buy a separate charger and a few extra batteries.  They are inexpensive and will allow you to quickly charge your batteries.  I hope this information is helpful.

I awarded a 4 star rating only because for 5 stars, I'd want the lens to be a little sharper at f2.8, not that it's soft there, it's very good and I don't hesitate to use it at 2.8, but it isn't excellent wide open, so it gets 4 stars. But it is a very sharp lens.  It's sharper than the 24-105, hands down, but IS is very nice; however, keep the shutter speed up: 1/500+.  Handheld, I don't get as many keepers at, say, 1/250sec, and am much more confident of getting the shot if I'm at least at 1/500, but safer still at 1/640.  Might mean using a little higher ISO than you are used to - maybe ISO 400 - but on a full frame body, this isn't much of an issue.  Monopod was no help.  The 135mm f2 is only a little shorter, yet I can handhold that lens at significantly lower shutter speeds.  Now that is a 5/5 lens.  I'm currently in Bali, giving the new lens a workout in the field.  I must say, though, that I spent a fair bit of time familiarising myself with this lens before traveling, particularly because of the shutter speed issue.  I have had to train myself to be constantly aware of shutter speed and my general stance and shooting technique, which is not completely new to me, just more so with this length lens.  But we are performing very well indeed and snapping some great shots, I think.  I'm glad I put the preparation into this lens before traveling.  My other companion on this trip is the 24-70 f2.8 mk II.  Another stellar lens.  They are a good travel kit, but if I had to take just one, it would be the 24-70 for its versatility.  It tolerates some heavy cropping with the 6D, so I can always pretend I was closer than I was.  Update:  Did I say I'd choose the 24-70 f2.8 mkii to travel with? Got back from Bali having shot the 200mm most of the trip.  Lots more.  Love being able to stand back and love the potential for out of focus background.  And love it's size and weight. Got some great shots with the 24-70, and if I'd been travelling with kids or friends, I'd have used it a lot more, but for what I like to shoot, the 200 was the one. The lack of IS still means more duds, but I'm pretty good now and with a few extras to choose from, not a big issue.  Update #2:  The lens is about a year old now and is almost always in the bag along with the 24-70 II ... a 70-200 zoom doesn't fit into my bag! Well, guess I could make it fit but clumsily.  Still highly recommend this lens for all kinds of situations, not just travel.  Out of the house, I use it all the time.","2015-01-03"],["US",11636014,"RC9FH28RSUZEM","B008DRA18I",685372637,"SVP ™ 18 Megapixel Digital Camera Series","Camera",5,2,2,"N","Y","Very nice for the price!","Saw where some people complained about the picture quality.

It's a Sony, it's got a Carl Zeiss Tessar Lens, it is 11.9 MP sensor, is small and water resistant to 5m.    Took it on holiday with the kids and got pictures of them in the pool and at the water park, and they're quite tickled to see them.  Generally pleased with the purchase.    The camera itself is a rounded body with buttons on the rear and on one side.  The base has a cover which extends from the front to the rear of the camera and houses the various connectors.  The rear opens to expose the memory card and battery compartment.    The memory card gave me some problems initially with the screen flashing on insertion of the card.  This is caused either by the card being inserted in the wrong direction (there are small markings on the cover - one direction for Micro SD and another for Memory Stick),  or the formatting of the card.  A brand new card would not work for me until I removed all the partitions - I did this using my Linux PC and running gparted.    Once the memory card was recognised, the camera worked flawlessly.  It can take photos, videos and interval shots.    Some points to note:    + Without the plastic waterproof case, the camera has no thread mount for a tripod.  Due to its rounded base, it also cannot stand upright without this case.  So the plastic water resistant case is quite necessary.  The front of the case holds the camera in position.    + If you bring the camera enclosed in the case from an air-conditioned room to the beach or pool, you may get condensation forming on the inside of the case as the camera gets warm during operation.    + When connected to Sony's \\\\\"Play Memories Mobile\\\\\", your smartphone can act as viewfinder allowing you remote control of the camera.  You can view pictures but not playback video.","2015-01-03"],["US",10838767,"R9AFF3A1NNTA6","B00OGRQXJU",803097259,"Syma X5C Quadcopter Drone with HD Camera and extra battery in exclusive Blue design","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","pretty durable and sturdy","Bought this for my husband and he's obsessed with it!!

You can purchase a RF-602 TX or RF-603TX and trigger the flashes wirelessly.. until now, this has been a nice little bonus but with the YN560TX, it adds the ability to remotely change the power levels of the flashes from the camera itself (opposed to just sending a trigger signal). This is a great feature, one usually reserved for higher-cost ETTL models.<br /><br />A few nice features on it:<br /><br />* The YN560TX can pair up to 6 groups. You can have an A, B, C, D, E, F group and adjust each light separately.. If you assign 2 flashes to an &#34;A&#34; group, changing that setting on the YN560TX will change it on all &#34;A&#34; group flashes.<br />* You can set the YN560TX to either RF602 or RF603 and 16 different channels each -- if you have an older flash (like a YN560II) you will need a RF602 or RF603 receiver to trigger the flash (Note: the wireless control will not work on YN560 or YN560II -- you need the 560III or newer). It will only trigger a RF602/603.<br />* If you change the power with the YN560TX, you can also trigger those flashes with a RF602/RF603 transmitter set to the same channel (EX: Using 2 cameras one with a YN560TX and one with a RF602/RF603)<br /><br />On to the product -- it's a nice design - it looks like someone cut a YN560 in half and took off the flash head -- even down to the red front cover (which appears to be functionless/decoration-only?)<br />Construction is solid, buttons are good and it has a good viewing angle/backlight (green)<br /><br />Setup is a bit tricky as there are 4 buttons, a TEST light, up/down/left/right/center and an on-off switch.. this means lots of holding multiple buttons at once to set features. For example, hold MODE+HZ/FN to change from RF602 to RF603.. A lot of these aren't very clear, and if in the field and needing to &#34;fix&#34; something, can be quite a challenge (even with the instruction manual, due to the way it's written). A nicer method would have been to have a &#34;Settings&#34; menu to change these rather than button presses (pressing 1 button, holding the same button, and holding the same button + another button all product different features).<br /><br />The hotshoe is metal ad has a locking/twist mechanism which is nice. The item's lightweight, even with batteries.. but it's pretty bulky (not deducting points for, since a lot of that is due to the screen size and buttons), but it's worth noting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where I started to discover some problems were with it being somewhat unreliable when using multiple -- I picked up 3 of these to use with 3 different cameras. You CAN use multiple together, but settings don't always send the way you'd like them to. For example I'll call these 560TX-A and 560TX-B<br />If 560TX-A is set to 1/1 power on channel A and 560TX-B is set to 1/4 power on channel A, the one which was set LAST takes priority. If you want the 2nd transmitters' settings to send, you need to use the &#34;Group&#34; button to highlight the channel (EX: &#34;A&#34;) for about 2 seconds for it to send that signal. If using 1 channel, it's not bad.. if using 3, 4, 5 or 6 it's kind of annoying. I bought this thinking it sent the &#34;power level&#34; signal when it transmitted the &#34;Flash&#34; signal, which is not the case.<br /><br />My other gripe was that it was hit or miss, even at close distances (~5 feet). With fresh batteries in a brand new YN560III and in the YN560TX, I would have some flashes failing to &#34;flash&#34; every few shots.. Trying with a RF602 transmitter, the problem went away. I don't know why it does this, and it would alternate between flashes that wouldn't fire (the flashes were recharged, on a lower level (not overheating) and tried with multiplesets of new batteries in each and different YN560TX's). Outdoors seemed to work better, howeversets of new batteries in each and different YN560TX's).

I discovered what the issues were by contacting the Q-See tech support.  If you are familiar with port forwarding your installation will be a little easier. I rate this a 4 instead of a 5 for the following reasons. 1. The website camera will go offline every now and then.  2. The infra red camera images are not clear after about 15 feet (you can detect movement but images are blurry. make sure you point the camera to an area that is lighted or will get light from your flood lights, which I eventually did.)<br /><br />My overall assessment of this product is good for the money. You may have to drill some holes to attach the camera and power wires to the video security system. I have a 2400 square foot home and the system using 5 camera's cover about 80 percent of the exterior. I use three cameras the cover my front living room, my garage entrance to the interior to the home, and to the rear deck door area.<br /><br />One other point; I use this item in conjunction with my monitored security system, barred sliding glad doors. 4 motion detectors, and glass break detectors on each window. The area in which I love is not consider a high crime area, but we do experience breaking and entering with a raise in property theif. If you use this system in conjunction with other deterrents I am sure you will be very comfortable with your overall security.  I hope this helps.

I bought this Nikon to take on a European trip. This camera is pretty standard for a point and shoot. I do like the extended zoom and all the little bells and whistles. I really hate the pop up flash, it is quite annoying. Most of my photos didn't require a flash so it was quite easy to turn off. It is also easy to edit the photos. I used a very fast card in the camera. The card and battery are easy to remove. One thing missing from these type of cameras is a viewfinder. I did purchase an extra battery. Another thing missing is a separate battery charger, but Nikon  includes a cord to charge the battery while in the phone. I don't like that feature at all. It was quite easy to sync the camera with my wireless router  transfer and post photos online. However, there is no manual included, everything is online. Nikon has an app for that, just saying.

HOWEVER, this camera came with a 1- year warranty and only lasted several months before it no longer turned on. sakar/vivitar lied to me and gave me the run-around, telling me to call this person and that person and that someone would call me back after so long. i waited weeks at a time for people to call me back. this kept up until i was after the one year mark. when i finally was directed to the right person, my warranty was over. at that point, they REFUSED to help me. they did that on purpose so that they did not have to reimburse me or replace my camera. i went to best buy and bought a great Sony camera that is soooo much better and then sakar/vivitar finally sent me a replacement in the mail-but only because before i bought my new camera i had told a little fib to sakar/vivitar that because they purposely delayed speaking to me until they had ran me out of time on my warranty, i would be cancelling a $300 purchase. the truth is, there was no other purchase and i will NEVER be buying from this company again.","2015-01-03"],["US",31869789,"RSMXKVSZB4I1E","B00FGHODK0",672216551,"Micca Neo-Series 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with Ultra Slim Design (M709A)","Camera",5,3,3,"N","N","Well Worth the Money!!!!","Honestly, I can't say enough about this product to do it justice.<br />I got this as a present for my parents. I'll say right off the bat the controls/menu navigation is not user-friendly but what it lacks there it makes up for where it counts. I did a lot of research on digital frames. I found there are fantastic frames available for at least double the price. The more expensive devices allow one to sync with other devices, communicate with social media, maybe even make you breakfast-who knows.... Many of these have a viewing ratio similar to the new TV'S out now (widescreen)  while this looks nice, most pictures are still 4:3 (standard portrait-type pictures). This means there'll either be unused space on the display or pictures will be stretched/compressed making the pictures look horrible. Another issue I discovered on more expensive models is the poor viewing angle. The 15&#34; Micca is very plain but the pictures look fantastic! The viewing angle is incredible. I walked all over a large room after setting up the device and the pictures looked amazing from everywhere in the room.<br />The stand is cheap but functional. There are mounting holes allowing the device to be mounted on a wall. It has an SD card slot and a USB port (it ships with an 8GB SD card). It also comes with a remote which I found essential to navigating the menu because the buttons were difficult to use while trying to watch the screen.<br />In short, this device is well worth the money (I got it on Amazon for about $100...a little over that, don't remember). It won't win awards for Human Factors engineering but if you simply want a digital portrait displaying your photos amazingly well then get this one!!!!<br />I'm not adding review details about the music player or calendar functions because my parents had no interest in that aspect of the device, apologies.","2015-01-03"],["US",34180756,"R2WLBT074SDNDZ","B006Y0YZZ6",670151863,"Photive Original LP-E8 Ultra High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Canon T2i and T3i (Canon LP-E8 Replacement)","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","They work very good with my Canon camera.

She loves it.  I preloaded 200 pictures to the web, added family members that can email new pictures to the web, and tested the automated email web upload.  Everything worked fine.  There were a number of web site delays and disconnects but this was during December, thus could have been a surge of new customers hitting the servers.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because of some software glitches described below.  But I'm fairly confident these will be addressed over time.<br /><br />Specific comments on some of the features:<br />The ability to load pictures to the web, or send pictures via email, to a distant relative's frame is awesome!  This is a great gift for distant relatives or friends, and for someone who isn't technical, giving them an easy way to receive and display photos.<br /><br />I like the ability to manage settings via the frame or via the web.  But there is one glitch I found with this, which will hopefully be corrected with software updates.  The sizing option ' fit to frame' works when selected via the frame settings, but does not work when selected via the web settings. I bought both the 12 inch and 8 inch frame.  Now I'm not sure if the issue was only on the 12 inch or both (I don't have the 8 inch with me to test anymore).  The alternate sizing option of 'fill the frame' is not useful for many of my photos, it cuts off the full photo and rolls around the photo while displaying.  Using 'fit to frame' is the solution.  As a result of these two issues I needed to have my mothers frame set to local settings rather than web, which is hard because she is not tech savvy and changing the settings in the future is not something she can manage.<br /><br />The option to set what time the frame 'sleeps, will override the user turning off the frame.  I set it for midnight-8 am, then sometime during the day I turned off the frame.  Within 30 minutes the frame turns itself back on. Once I disabled the sleep interval the frame will stay off when I turn it off.  The user turning off the frame should override the sleep time in the settings.  The settings time should merely be a fallback to ensure it is turned off if the user left it on.<br /><br />I have the two frames being managed in my single account, very nice to have one account for both.  I'm able to assign different playlists to the two frames, using the same source of picture albums loaded on the web.  The one issue is that emailed photos are assigned to a single playlist I configure.  A better solution would be for Nixplay to read the email subject line and assign a playlist based on the subject line.  In other words, have user configurable settings on the web where I assign a key word to each playlist and tell family members these key words that they can use in their email subject line, which tells Nixplay which playlist to put the picture in.  Include a default so that if the email subject line doesn't contain any keywords it will go to a default playlist. That way if I don't want the emailed picture to go to both frames I can have it automatically managed by playlist selection in the email subject line.<br /><br />The order of the playlists can be changed for each frame. A nice feature.  I made a playlist for emailed photos that precedes the other albums. The order of the pictures in the playlists can also be changed and rearranged, BUT it's glitchy.  I drag a picture to a new location in the list and drop it, but it shows up somewhere else when I look through the pictures on line.  I eventually figured out that as I dragged it I needed to look for the ghost of the picture, instead of where my cursor was at, even then it was hard to find the ghost to land it in the correct position.  This is a good feature, but needs to be improved.  It might be an issue based on which web browser is being used or which version of web browser?<br /><br />I have not found a way to play all folders on the USB stick automatically.  I can only select a folder or sub-folder and play all pictures in the folder.  I'd like a way to select a folder and have a slideshow of all pictures in that folder and any sub folders.  As well as a way to select the memory card or USB and play all pictures in all folders on that storage medium.  Though the menu option implies 'all photos', it only selects all photos in that folder or not in any folders, but will not select photos in other folders or sub folders.<br /><br />It would also be nice to have more slideshow transition options.  But not a big deal to not have them.<br /><br />The display itself and picture quality is great, I have no complaints.  At severe angles the picture is no longer viewable, which is normal for this type of display technology.<br /><br />Some folks have complained about the USB sticking out from behind the 8 inch frame, I purchased a micro USB stick and don't have that issue at all.<br /><br />I don't mind no touch screen, as others have commented it's better to not have the finger smudges on the frame.  The remote works great and works from 3 to 5 feet away for me.  My vision to see what I'm selecting is more an issue than the remote distance lol.<br /><br />The USB stick gets quite hot.  I don't know whether that will turn out to be an issue or not.<br /><br />The remote button labeled 'back' doesn't go back to the prior screen.  It goes to the menu, which is a pain when working with multiple folders on the storage devices. This should be corrected as a software glitch.<br /><br />The option to display the time along with the photos is nice, but the time display is way to large, covering too much of the photo.  It should be smaller or perhaps make it vertical instead of horizontal.<br /><br />Overall I'm quite happy with both frames, I have recommended them to friends, and my mom loves it ( except when I tried to talk her through turning on the 'over ride web settings' option - ah, another improvement could be to add this option to the web settings so I could have enabled that for her from the web).  All glitches I found can be corrected via software or firmware updates and this company appears to have a solid history of paying attention to feedback and working through any software issue found, as well as making steady improvements in their feature set both on the web and on the frames.and play all pictures in the folder.

My husband and I ordered them and it was a hot mess. I knew they weren't wireless, but unless you want to deal with an incredible amount of cords, don't buy it. Here are some major problems I had with it:<br /><br />1. The instructions made absolutely NO sense (even for my dad who's typically great with these sorts of things). In one section it said the DVR would have a red light when on, and then later was contradicted by saying the light should be green. There was no &#34;power&#34; button on the DVR that the instructions kept referring to. When we finally got it hooked up to the TV, the screen would come on for a few seconds and go off. The instructions were confusing because there barely were any. It left us with more questions than answers. It real didn't tell us how to do anything.<br />2. The amount of cords for these cameras is INSANE! It was quite overwhelming seeing the whopping amount of cords that came with it. Even with the cords being so long, and our house being rather small, it was difficult to connect everything we needed to. There were zillions of things to connect.<br /><br />OK really I guess that's it. That's as far as we got before we boxed it up and shipped it right on back to where it came from. If I were you, I'd look into Lorex wireless cameras. They are a little more expensive, but worth it considering they are great quality and no hassle!!","2015-01-03"],["US",23471704,"R34S6NG4OSRZV5","B00KKUI4I0",264417064,"Camera Strap - Soft Padded Black Neoprene Lightweight Adjustable Comfortable Designer Sling for Your Valued Canon Nikon Pentax Sony DSLR - Anti-Slip - For Guys & Women - Quick Release Design","Camera",4,0,0,"N","N","Good strap","I've had a chance to use this strap on a few occasions and after getting used to the fact that the camera is upside down the strap is very comfortable.

Details below","Simpleton's review:<br /><br />It works just as advertised. Thanks. Words words words words words words words words words words.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Intellect's review<br /><br />&#34;Is that a GoPro?&#34;<br /><br />-Every camera waving function I've ever been to. Airsoft fields, corporate events, brony meetups, anime conventions, you name it.<br /><br />I'll fix some typos as I find them. Sorry if you find one before I do. Also this review is too long. AMZ keeps cutting it.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />I uploaded some great photos before but AMZ forgot about them and they disappeared. Sorry. Also one thing I noticed was Veho's marketing division did a really good job of hiding photos of the backside of a K2, no LCD screen.<br /><br />This review is intended for owners of the Veho MUVI HD10 (or Veho MUVI HD NPNG).<br /><br />It's also rather long so if you prefer the common Simpleton Amazonian Review please scroll back up and use that so you can return to your previous camera waving pursuits without need for detail.<br /><br />If you're a first time action camera buyer, this review probably won't help you at all especially with all the other choices you have (GoPro, Sony, Garmin, Polaroid, Contour). Not to mention Veho's slightly negative reputation for not honoring their warranties, though I don't think they have one. I've been using the Veho MUVI HD10 for about a year with no major problems and pretty darn satisfied so I'm fine but if you value piece of mind (or you're careless with your electronics) bear in mind you're probably on your own here. Point is, there are a lot of companies fighting over GoPro's piece of the cake which economically makes sense since we get some nifty innovation, but it's hard to compare side by side which is better and it's not just megapixel these days. Most DSLRs can produce photos better than most mobile phones but who wants to carry some expensive rock around all day? No one apparently because Nikon and Canon and losing a ton of money since everyone is on Instagram with their selfies and overly retro hipster filters.<br /><br />And if you're a GoPro owner with any of the more recent models, you're probably very satisfied with your current camera and need not to be here unless you're looking for more volume or better features like sound (more so compared with older models)<br /><br />About me: Slightly young, inspiring, and independent camera whipper since high school. I wanted to do more video but demand was in for photography so I've been waving about my DSLR when needed. Nothing is beyond me as I've done event photography big and small, from the glamorous white lined tables to down in the dirt: from friend's 10 person birthday parties and animal shelter openings to corporate dinners and golf courses at the Rosen' spanning at least 100 tables. From fundraisers at card shops and restaurants to business meetings/talks in downtown's most exclusive country club overlooking the city. Money has already been exchanged over what I do. And I've also been working the N.L.E. for a couple of years too, from musical performances at comic shops and conventions to theater style plays at conventions and at school. Oh, and I tried my hand some not so successful film festivals. I lost. Still good fun.<br /><br />Basically, I've done this photo, video, (and audio, a lot of people forget audio) before. I'll probably get a GoPro like everyone else if I have enough money/need for it unless Veho steps up their game. Or Contour. Lots to choose from. It's nice, but on the other hand you first time action camera buyers can get really confused. Everyone's got a GoPro and occasionally I'll be on an airsoft field and two guys on a team have a Contour. I'm that guy who has what looks like a GoPro but isn't.<br /><br />Short version: Veho MUVI K2 vs HD10. It's in upgrade in most respects. Video quality, versatility, WiFi, product dimensions, Heck, it sometimes feels like a different camera. This newer model is definitely more versatile though. There's some notes the HD10 that I miss though, but I welcome the obviously clearer looking video and increased versatility over the HD10. Especially since I know I had to work hard to pay for them. No company ever gave me a free camera.<br /><br />Also K1 buyers note the difference between the K1 and K2 is mostly bit rate. Whether you value the extra cash for the higher bit rate is up to you, and whether high bit rate is purely master race importance to you, see bottom. Whether having the money to go big and decide to go small is a personal crime, is up to you.<br /><br />NPNG buyers get more accessories. I will assume you are all smart enough to determine which points of this review are invalid.<br />-----------<br /><br />Compared to the MUVI HD...<br /><br />-Size<br /><br />As they proudly state on the site, the K2 is in fact smaller. Probably 3/4th the size of the old model. Probably achieved by getting that LCD screen out.<br /><br />-HDMI Out<br /><br />Only minor bug is if you somehow bought a mini HDMI cable to watch your HD10 on the big screen or connect as a webcam via capture card, that won't natively do you with the K2. Time to buy a new HDMI cable then.<br /><br />-Belt clip/alligator clip<br /><br />Not this time. Sorry private security people. The old base Veho MUVI HD package had one which was great for attaching to backpacks, belts, work uniforms, etc. That clip with the HD won't do you good with the K2. Veho is consulting their friends to release one so we have to wait. I miss my belt clip already. I bought a REC Mount 360 Rotary clip though so partially resolved. I say partially because..well, see the next section. As for the REC Mount, go look it up, I won't go into detail here.<br /><br />-Tripod screw + lack of compatibility with previous mounts<br /><br />Yes, tripod screw is still on the bottom which is still convenient compared to smooth bottoms of GoPros. Skeleton mount for the Veho MUVI what's that?<br /><br />Given: As I said, the old cup HD10 mounts you got with your HD10 package, forget about it.<br /><br />Downgrade: my K2 tripod screw is recessed deeper than my HD which means my normal Veho prong to tripod screw mount (the ones that came with the HD10 NPNG package for mounting the waterproof case to a helmet or chest mount), so I can not natively attach my K2 to my other Veho mounts. I don't know if this is QC or not. Basically the start of the tripod threading is too deep so it will never attach to my old HD era mounts: helmet/head mount, chest mount, etc.<br /><br />Four ways to circumvent K2 not attaching to your old HD10 era tripod mounts (namely the prong system to tripod conversion, aka waterproof adapter)<br /><br />1. Cheap tripod screw used for DSLR brackets. You know those 1/4-20 thumbscrews with male on top and a circular base plate with female on the bottom? If you stick on to the K2 and then screw it to the older adapters, you're good to go. I fixed my REC Mount clip that way once so I could attach my K2 to a backpack (since the old adapters won't work). Chances are you'll have to toss that in an EDC bag because some tripods threads are in fact too long for the K2, which means even if you screw the tripod head all the way into the K2, it'll spin around and be loose. I had that problem with the HD10 when doing a video shoot with one of Central Florida's finest balloon artists. I fixed with two cents though.<br /><br />2. Buy adapter with a longer tripod screw. I personally fired from the hip and dark bought a Rec-mounts Gp-cn-m conversion adapter. I can't recommend it now since the Japanese want you to pay +$22 for a small piece of plastic and that's really crazy, but when it arrive I was surprised to discover the screw was long enough to natively attach the K2 without a tripod screw from 1. Now I can easily attach my K2 to my belt clip, which means easy K2 to backpack video. Other Asia sellers might work though. I can't promise.<br /><br />3. Replace the screw from the current HD10 era adapter with a longer one. This one takes engineering and scavenging so I can't recommend it as I can't do it myself. Theoretically it makes sense though. The winning prize is you can save a good amount of money. If you're lazy like me, try the above.<br /><br />4. Use the waterproof case. I use this cameras on land so having to attach the waterproof in a nonviolent area and deal with the bad sound is a white person problem.<br /><br />Remember: Old MUVI HD mounts, remember those cups with the screw you may or may not have gotten? Those won't do you good any more. The prong to tripod screw ones for the waterproof case in the NPNG package will though as well as your old mounting bases (the adhesives, suction cups, car screw kits, RAM Mounts as I use one, etc)<br /><br />-Lens<br /><br />Fancy math and technical f/2.7 aside, the lens size looks roughly the same. Sharpness? Does it really matter? How does one sharp a piece of glass anyway?<br /><br />My K2 came with a removable flange lens hood to protect the lens when not in the waterproof case. That was really neat. The hood doesn't fit in the case of course, so you'll have to take it out.<br /><br />Physics: Also improved was the distance between the lens and the tripod socket since the K2 is pretty much on top of the socket where as the HD is a couple of inches away from the bottom (like a GoPro). This means slightly less shaking on most mounting scenarios. Example, if the point of pivot is below the camera, you will realize less shaking in the K2 than the HD. Horizontal mounting yield most benefits includes surf boards, helmet/head straps, chest straps, most bicycles, dashboard cameras, most car roll cages, etc. It's hard to explain, but imagine you have a piece of string and you spin it clockwise over your head like a lasso. Which part of the string will move the most? The one closer to your hand or furthest?<br /><br />-Battery<br /><br />Oh sweet Celestia, yes. The K2 has a removable Li-ion battery with a sticker naming it the Veho DS-S50 at 3.7V 1500 mAh 5.5Wh. I don't know (or really care all that much) what those numbers mean alone, but in battery life I'll get to that soon, but know the fact the battery is removable means you don't have to mid combat recharge.<br /><br />HD10 out of battery? Wall charger or a USB power bank (Veho would like to remind you to buy the Pebble brand pebble) and wait 3 hours because the HD10's battery is locked away well inside.<br /><br />K2 out of battery? If you bought a second battery, simply replace it.<br /><br />Also important is MUVI HD function is tied to the mini USB port. So if that were to damage or break on the MUVI HD, you can't recharge your camera again, which means it broke. Well bummer. The good news is if Veho starts selling standalone battery chargers or extended battery packs(they don't sell one yet, but hopefully will) and you were to completely wreck the mini USB port (or it just breaks), you're still in the game. For the above, we wait to see if Veho were to contact their friends over in the Shenzhen, PRC, if you know what I mean. Heh heh heh.<br /><br />-Battery life<br /><br />Downgrade (while bearing in mind the power consumption required to bring the nicer looking video). I battery dumped the K2 twice and it appears to promise a total 1 button continuous record run time of 2 hours 30 minutes, where as the new HD10 runs a consistent 3 hours. My HD10 after +1 year of daily use only gets 2.5 hours now. Maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less. Wi-Fi, LCD, and other functions off of course (as well any other interaction which uses power), 720p60. (I'll get to those).<br /><br />I ran 1 battery dump with the Wi-Fi on and got a similar time: longest constant video 2:30 hours. It's statistically incorrect to assume the Wi-Fi doesn't use more power at this time though.<br /><br />GoPros (the main competitor and leader) get similar time so no compliant here. Just don't be thatsimpleton AMZ reviewer who 1 starred the GoPro entirely in a half sentence review &#34;battery lif was too short.&#34;<br /><br />Ways to resolve battery life if 2.5 hours really isn't enough for you:<br /><br />1. Buy post purchase batteries and exchange batteries when depleted<br /><br />2. Wait for friends in Shenzhen to talk about the attachable battery pack add on<br /><br />3. USB Power banks. All the trendy kids love their Ankler lip stick power banks for their size, but I like my power banks hungry so I got a PowerAdd recently. 10400 mAh means I can get 12 hours of video. TWELVE.<br /><br />My current Nvidia Gefore GT 630 lacks the memory cache and CUDA cores to render a 12 hour long video (720p60) within a week. The memory card, assuming 32 GB, at 720p60 will probably only get you ~4-6 hours of video. Times ~3 full memory cards.... ~96 GB. Then you have to upload that sucker. Most YouTube attention spans lose it around 5 minutes. Most pop music sounds boring after 3 minutes. Most television commercials that are 1 minute feel long. I saw a comment on a Vine FB page once complaining that 12 seconds was too long for a Vine. Sweet mother of Celestia where have we gone?<br /><br />Anyways.<br /><br />4. If recording in a car, stop whining like some cheapstake that the Veho MUVI VCC-A097 usb cable costs $15, and buy it, and you'll never be out of battery on the road (as it also works with the K2 as it did with the HD) which is important for road trips where you value having a dashboard video to show the state police. Cable, $15, not having to pay insurance + civil court room over an auto collision because you couldn't prove you were not at fault since your camera ran out, probably more than $15. Suck it up. Don't be a complainer.<br /><br />5. Turn off the extra features (WiFi, LCD screen if you bought it, etc)<br /><br />6. Stop recording during breaks.<br /><br />My K2 spends 90% of its time mounted upside down in my car fully connected to the cable so I don't get to reach the end of battery life that often. With my PowerAdd power bank as I said that came in yesterday, I'll keep it that way for in the field.<br /><br />-LCD Screen<br /><br />In my package (my package was not NPNG of course), no LCD screen accessory included. Veho MUVI HD buyers, sports people, security/law enforcement, and casuals raved on and on about the integrated LCD screen's ability to play back video right there on the spot (though as much space as it took and not to mention if you helmet mount it's kind of pointless not being able to see it), well now you'll have to buy one. The K2 has some minimalist screen on top that only tells you what mode you're in, battery, recording time left (an upgrade to the HD10), etc, but it won't tell you what you're looking at. Oh, and if you use the K2 waterproof case you got in the regular package? You need a new backdoor to fit the LCD screen since the waterproof case is completely flush fit for no accessories. As I said, it's both a down and upgrade as having the LCD screen is nice, but having the K2 smaller than the HD and having it `$40 cheaper (MSRP of the LCD if it were included) for those of us who don't need the detachable LCD screen is even nicer.<br /><br />Veho sells the LCD screen and waterproof case backdoor you need to make it fit, according to their site.<br /><br />Good news for most of you with modern phones. You don't need the LCD screen anymore because you now have...<br /><br />-WiFi<br /><br />Upgrade all the way. Wi-Fi is enabled by a switch directly below the record button. I have an iPhone and got the Veho K2 app that allows me to live preview the video (2-4 second delay), watch old video, change some of the settings, take video, take photo, etc. Why bother with an LCD screen if you can plant the K2 on your helmet and look through your phone? Both your phone and the K2 probably use more battery though, so note that.<br /><br />WiFi works by enabling the switch, installing the app (do they have it for Androids? I think so), tell your phone to join the network, then run the app. The app looks like some older HTML webpage so it's not the most pretty, but what do you want to pay someone to work on, the camera or making some app pretty?<br /><br />Of course, if you have some older Nokia still circulating overseas (as durability is more valued than fancy features on a fragile device), you'll have to miss out.<br /><br />Minor annoyance: In order to watch videos on a mobile phone (via WiFi), the K2 creates thumbnail videos (.THM), which is fine, but sometimes it forgets WiFi is off and makes them anything. They take up space on the memory card. Not a lot, but if you're on the edge for space, they do add up.<br /><br />-Button Function<br /><br />Good or bad?<br /><br />Depends on how you use it. I like it. You might not.<br /><br />The button order, I could do into detail but the manual is publicly available in PDF form.<br /><br />Just know this, with the Veho MUVI HD (and the GoPro) the record button is also used as the stop button, but with the K2 there is a button to record and a separate button you have to press to stop recording. Kind of like the old HD10 remote.<br /><br />It's complex but I personally like this system because there is no doubt. When I play airsoft where the camera is attached to my head entirely and we have breaks between rounds where I stop recording to save power, I can forget if I'm recording or not recording so if I press the button, am I now not recording or did I just start recording? It's a losing game. I'll either stop recording and miss out on a good moment or start wasting battery by recording generic break footage (and then eventually end up in a future point where I have to stop recording sooner). The lazy solution is to always record. Well....<br /><br />With the K2, if you spam press the record button, you will know you're always recording. If you spam press the stop button, you will always know you stopped record. Of course some of you probably are used to the one button to start and same button to stop, so you won't like it as much, but I welcome this complex system. It'll take some memory to get though.<br /><br />-Waterproof case<br /><br />Still keeping the water out. I don't get to run the waterproof cases in water that much but I test them every now and then. Do not clean your waterproof cases with any cloth as the box says. If cotton fabric gets on the seals it could compromise right open. Use a hair dryer or shake it.<br /><br />The direction of the latch is a little different. I'd explain it but, uh, I won't. Go look at the photos.<br /><br />There's threads on the back. The NPNG package's waterproof case had a huge clip for those that want to clip the waterproof on something. I've yet to find mine in my package. Well, I got the regular K2 so maybe not.<br /><br />Oh, and maybe the new case looks a bit cooler? The old HD case was mostly see through and looks like a water bottle where as the K2 has a front plate in black and I guess looks like a Stealth Jet. Maybe not. One thing is certain, with the black box being attached around your helmet hopefully nobody will mistake it for those pearly white GoPros.<br /><br />There's still the MUVI branding text on it, as with the unit itself. Guess the K2 wasn't really catering for the private security industry this time, though the HD works fine for that.<br /><br />There's a small removable screw/knob thing whatever on the right side of the waterproof case that's intended for some future optional mini USB lavier microphone for those who don't want to deal with waterproof sound, I'll get to that in a bit. The GoPro hobo solution is a skeleton case or to drill a bleeding hole into your $50 no-longer-waterproof case. The GoPro hi-tier solution is to buy some special case that supports waterproof and 3.5mm mics to an extent. Is there even a waterproof microphone? Maybe.<br /><br />Semi related note: I had the chance to dashboard camera a GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition once. Dashboard camera no waterproof case K2, it survived being in direct Florida grade sunlight for +2 hours. My friend's GoPro Hero 4 waterproof case auto turned off after about an hour or so. Basically, don't leave them in direct solution for an hour. It hurts.<br /><br />Hurts the camera or you?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />-Sound<br /><br />Yeah it's slightly better than the HD, which was a lot better than most GoPros back then. No telephone sounding audio here. It's still in mono as it always is and should be (except for a few stand out action cameras). But although it sounds clearer, you can hear a quiet beeping/hum from the camera that wasn't with the HD10. Oh well.<br /><br />Why does sound matter so much?<br /><br />Most of these cameras will spend their life in the waterproof case and if you ever heard a waterproof case camera, it doesn't sound fun, whether in 44.1 kHz or in 11 kHz. If sound is a buying factor for you action camera (which statistically is spent surfing, sky diving, high speed biking, racing, etc other sports that are hazardous to your expensive camera when not protected), you may be doing it wrong.<br /><br />As I said, there's an unrelased mini USB microphone that plugs to the side of the camera if you're so inclined, but you won't find out about it here for a while.<br /><br />True story: some Amazon pleb downvoted the MUVI HD10 because the sound in the waterproof case sucked and said to buy a GoPro (which apparently sounds better in the case). If you find that pleb on Amazon, stop what you're doing and run away before he/she tries talking to you.<br /><br />-Low light performance<br /><br />Better than the MUVI HD. Yes. I see it. Even my casual nonphotographer friend sees it. No more HD10 wild frame rate halving and high contrast light gradients on the road as I use mine as a dashboard camera.<br /><br />Every camera stinks in low light. Every. Veho, GoPro, Sony, Garmin, Polaroid, Nikon, Canon, Fujifilm, Olympus, Pentax, Kodak, iPhone, etc. You could modify your camera to receive infrared light similar to surveillance cameras for home/business use and then setup infrared emitters, but you'd only make us more jealous.<br /><br />Dashboard camera users: remember with the limited dynamic range these mechanical devices have, the act of trying to properly meter road with street lights and headlights shining directly at the camera makes it hard to achieve that oh so magical ability to read license plates at, say, 20 feet at night that the human eye can.<br /><br />Either way, anyone experienced with the ~15 FPS low light footage of the Veho MUVI HD will have a fabulous time seeing the low light footage of the K2. There's a video on YT somewhere of the HD10 vs K2 low light. I wonder who. Semi colon right parenthesis.<br /><br />-Included micro SD card<br /><br />Was it included? If it was, it's probably the same. Both not worth it. You're about to dump a hundred or so on a camera, surely you can get the card for it.<br /><br />Go buy a SanDisk Class 10 one for 32 GB and you could get around 4 hours of video (note 2.5 hours battery life). I say SanDisk because it seems to be the most universally accepted card for DSLRs. All your other off brands like Transcend, PNY, heck, even Sony or Kingston, maybe. If they work for you, great, but my reputation is at risk here so I'm not letting my camera stop during an event because I'm trying to be cheap.<br /><br />64 GB? My friend got me a SanDisk 64 GB card this week and I've been testing it. It seems to worth but I can't warrant an opinion yet, too early. I did a DC power test though with the K2 and successfully got 8.5 hours of video at 960P60.<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget to keep a micro SD to SD adapter in your car if you use it as a dashboard camera. If you get smashed on the interstate, most LEO laptops don't natively read microSD, but reading SD? More likely.<br /><br />-Video modes.<br /><br />Okay. Mixed. Downgrade? Upgrade? I don't know how I feel about this one. I call it token 1080P. The site says 1080P, the device says 1080P, the resulting MP4 file says 1080P, but it doesn't feel like 1080P. I tried 720P60 for a while but now I run it 960P. Why?<br /><br />At CES 2014 Engadget said VEHO said 34 Mbps which was fine, but on the website and on my unit its highest is 19 Mbps. What does this mean? I'm starting to believe with only 19 Mbps in a second to work with, the more larger and faster frames you put, the less data you have on each individual frame.<br /><br />Lazy math. 720/1080 = 66%. 19 / 66%? ~28. Almost 34 Mbps. You see this? I don't know what it means, but if we want consistent frame quality the Mbps should increase, especially if the FPS does.<br /><br />When I first got my K2 I ran a driving test (day time) with the 1080p30 from the K2 and the 1080P30 from the HD. Though my test wasn't scientific, I found despite the K2 having more FOV than the HD, there were signs on the HD I was unable to read on the K2 despite both cameras being close to each other. It would seem the 1080P on the K2 is either slightly worse or the FOV was too wide. Even FOV wide aside, I noticed more artifacts combined to the HD10. Does this mean fraud and we should run away? Hopefully not as it may require more testing, but I looked at the K2 for lower settings on the list, 720p60, and found it satisfactory for 720P. 720P120 however yields more less sharp video (by Mbps rule) than 60. After a month of using 720P60, I changed it to 960P60 because by plugging the HDMI cable into my tv screen I found that the photo mode resolution and the 960P resolution are very close, so I'm assuming it's maybe the native resolution.<br /><br />My opinion: I don't use the K2 for 1080P. 960P60 is great and heck, most of you can survive on 720P. Does lack of mind blowing 1080P mean it's automatically a bad camera? Read way below for philosophy.<br /><br />-Misc unorganized notes, also publicly available in the manual.<br /><br />Owners of the HD10/NPNG noted there was some 1/20th chance upon power up that sound wouldn't be recorded, which made it a turn off for some L.E.O.s. I circumvented this by listening for the beeping sound on the HD10. With the K2, no sound bug so far. Daily use since I bought it in December.<br /><br />Digital zoom, why? Still here with the K2 though as a menu for choosing a set of predetermined FOVs and through the app where it's fine adjustable like the HD10 was on 720P. Does it stay after a shut down? I don't know. Who cares.<br /><br />Audio only feature, if for some reason you elected to spent $200 again on a device that only captures audio as a backup (or you're doing covert wiretapping action), fine, yes, it's still here.<br /><br />Auto standby. Still here. Whether you need it or not, your call.<br /><br />Timestamps. What about them? Unless you're working private security, have an untraceable YouTube channel to place your dashboard video (where timestamps could incriminate your routes), or on vacation, you probably don't need them, but the K2 apparently has them. But they work. And look slightly more...timestampy than the HD10.<br /><br />Loop record still around. Dashboard camera users rejoice, no deleting files after every drive. Theoretically, with a proper power supply you could record a full duration of 32 GB, ~4 hours or so, in one press, or 64 GB, 8 hours. That reminds me<br /><br />Video files are still split up every x minutes. Maybe 10? I'm a smart guy who can work an N.L.E. and combine them so nonissue.<br /><br />Selectable spot focus for exposure also here. No idea what that is? Look it up. If you don't know what it is, chances are you don't need it. I know I don't.<br /><br />Remember the selectable green light self-timer on the front face of the HD10? The K2 has a similar light. It's this hilarious blue ring that surrounds the record button and is probably visible in a dashboard situation at night from yards away. A lot brighter than the old green light. Waterproof case hides it which is good for airsofting in low light. I was at a convention related meetup with the K2 doing video and some guys said it looked like the Chase bank logo. Nonetheless the K2 apparently has a way to turn it off, but I find it hilarious to keep on. If you walk around in public with the blue light on everyone will be asking about your &#34;GoPro.&#34;<br /><br />HD10 vox mode? No more in the K2. Now there's some G-Sensor thing that apparently starts the camera when it's shaken. I've yet to use it.<br /><br />180-Degree Image Flip on the K2 says it can automatically detect when the camera is upside and correct it, a plus for the dashboard camera upside down mounters. Nah. On my camera it's just a switch that flips all video. And then it forgets the setting every couple of hours. Useless for me, though I'm smart enough to flip it on my own so nonissue.<br /><br />-Final idealistic thoughts on 1080P, bit rate (and to effect, the GoPro Master Race)<br /><br />I read some of action camera online community shaming the MUVI (at least those who even heard of the MUVI) saying it's a bad camera because the video quality (at this price) doesn't appear to top the GoPro.<br /><br />Mar 6 edit: I had like really long half technical half philosophical post and a fun story involving a photographer friend who owned a studio for 10 years who could not tell the difference between the K2 footage and his GoPro Hero 4 footage that I had both took for a test drive, but AMZ doesn't like this really long review, so I will simply say short like this:<br /><br />This is no guaranteed correlation between production costs and YT views.<br /><br />If you think getting expensive cameras will automatically grant your views success, I recommend you look up &#34;Vines.&#34; Chances are these little ~7 second videos filmed on iPhones have brought more views than most of us with our cute little &#34;GoPro test video&#34; (type that in YT). If views are what you seek, stop being a boring iPhone owner.<br /><br />But either way, it's a camera. You worked hard to pay for it, you deserve it, so go outside and find something, then look for someone who needs video help and be of use. No amount of camera doesn't deserve to collect dust and only be used a handful of times.<br /><br />Ask me your questions and I answer them the best I can.<br /><br />Anthonyve it for Androids? I think so), tell your phone to join the network, then run the app. The app looks like some older HTML webpage so it's not the most pretty, but what do you want to pay someone to work on, the camera or making some app pretty?<br /><br />Of course, if you have some older Nokia still circulating overseas (as durability is more valued than fancy features on a fragile device), you'll have to miss out.<br /><br />Minor annoyance: In order to watch videos on a mobile phone (via WiFi), the K2 creates thumbnail videos (.THM), which is fine, but sometimes it forgets WiFi is off and makes them anything.

Though my test wasn't scientific, I found despite the K2 having more FOV than the HD, there were signs on the HD I was unable to read on the K2 despite both cameras being close to each other. It would seem the 1080P on the K2 is either slightly worse or the FOV was too wide. Even FOV wide aside, I noticed more artifacts combined to the HD10. Does this mean fraud and we should run away? Hopefully not as it may require more testing, but I looked at the K2 for lower settings on the list, 720p60, and found it satisfactory for 720P. 720P120 however yields more less sharp video (by Mbps rule) than 60. After a month of using 720P60, I changed it to 960P60 because by plugging the HDMI cable into my tv screen I found that the photo mode resolution and the 960P resolution are very close, so I'm assuming it's maybe the native resolution.<br /><br />My opinion: I don't use the K2 for 1080P. 960P60 is great and heck, most of you can survive on 720P. Does lack of mind blowing 1080P mean it's automatically a bad camera? Read way below for philosophy.<br /><br />-Misc unorganized notes, also publicly available in the manual.<br /><br />Owners of the HD10/NPNG noted there was some 1/20th chance upon power up that sound wouldn't be recorded, which made it a turn off for some L.E.O.s. I circumvented this by listening for the beeping sound on the HD10. With the K2, no sound bug so far. Daily use since I bought it in December.<br /><br />Digital zoom, why? Still here with the K2 though as a menu for choosing a set of predetermined FOVs and through the app where it's fine adjustable like the HD10 was on 720P. Does it stay after a shut down? I don't know. Who cares.<br /><br />Audio only feature, if for some reason you elected to spent $200 again on a device that only captures audio as a backup (or you're doing covert wiretapping action), fine, yes, it's still here.<br /><br />Auto standby. Still here. Whether you need it or not, your call.<br /><br />Timestamps. What about them? Unless you're working private security, have an untraceable YouTube channel to place your dashboard video (where timestamps could incriminate your routes), or on vacation, you probably don't need them, but the K2 apparently has them. But they work. And look slightly more...timestampy than the HD10.<br /><br />Loop record still around. Dashboard camera users rejoice, no deleting files after every drive. Theoretically, with a proper power supply you could record a full duration of 32 GB, ~4 hours or so, in one press, or 64 GB, 8 hours. That reminds me<br /><br />Video files are still split up every x minutes. Maybe 10? I'm a smart guy who can work an N.L.E. and combine them so nonissue.<br /><br />Selectable spot focus for exposure also here. No idea what that is? Look it up. If you don't know what it is, chances are you don't need it. I know I don't.<br /><br />Remember the selectable green light self-timer on the front face of the HD10? The K2 has a similar light. It's this hilarious blue ring that surrounds the record button and is probably visible in a dashboard situation at night from yards away. A lot brighter than the old green light. Waterproof case hides it which is good for airsofting in low light. I was at a convention related meetup with the K2 doing video and some guys said it looked like the Chase bank logo. Nonetheless the K2 apparently has a way to turn it off, but I find it hilarious to keep on. If you walk around in public with the blue light on everyone will be asking about your &#34;GoPro.&#34;<br /><br />HD10 vox mode? No more in the K2. Now there's some G-Sensor thing that apparently starts the camera when it's shaken. I've yet to use it.<br /><br />180-Degree Image Flip on the K2 says it can automatically detect when the camera is upside and correct it, a plus for the dashboard camera upside down mounters. Nah. On my camera it's just a switch that flips all video. And then it forgets the setting every couple of hours. Useless for me, though I'm smart enough to flip it on my own so nonissue.<br /><br />-Final idealistic thoughts on 1080P, bit rate (and to effect, the GoPro Master Race)<br /><br />I read some of action camera online community shaming the MUVI (at least those who even heard of the MUVI) saying it's a bad camera because the video quality (at this price) doesn't appear to top the GoPro.<br /><br />Mar 6 edit: I had like really long half technical half philosophical post and a fun story involving a photographer friend who owned a studio for 10 years who could not tell the difference between the K2 footage and his GoPro Hero 4 footage that I had both took for a test drive, but AMZ doesn't like this really long review, so I will simply say short like this:<br /><br />This is no guaranteed correlation between production costs and YT views.<br /><br />If you think getting expensive cameras will automatically grant your views success, I recommend you look up &#34;Vines.&#34; Chances are these little ~7 second videos filmed on iPhones have brought more views than most of us with our cute little &#34;GoPro test video&#34; (type that in YT). If views arewhat you seek, stop being a boring iPhone owner.<br /><br />But either way, it's a camera. You worked hard to pay for it, you deserve it, so go outside and find something, then look for someone who needs video help and be of use. No amount of camera doesn't deserve to collect dust and only be used a handful of times.<br /><br />Ask me your questions and I answer them the best I can.<br /><br />Anthonyd in some \\\\\"test video\\\\\".    I'll spin it another way, you could always hit big views, subscribers, and money with the top guys in GoPro, but wouldn't it make a better book and radio interview if you went the underdog way?    All bickering aside, the most important part of buying a camera, go out, use it, record something neat today and then help someone without a camera record something tomorrow. You worked hard, you earned it, you deserve it, and it's now your duty to serve those who can't.    All questions/comment/discussion/\\\\\"I disagree with you and here's why\\\\\"/ most welcome.

I got this pack in a bundle with a Canon T5, and it fits great with two lenses and plenty more.<br /><br />I've pushed and pulled on it, and the quality of the one I got seems great.  Love the flexibility of the dividers on the inside.  If it's not evident from the picture, you can configure it to have separate compartments for pretty much any fragile bits you might be taking with you.<br /><br />Also, and this is VERY important for someone like me, the orange looks good.  My camera is not a source of income, it's a hobby, a fun toy basically, and I want accesories that look good.  This fits the bill, making me look and feel more professional than I am, without feeling like I'm being too full of myself.  I'm not so in love with orange and black that I'm going to run out and buy an Oklahoma State jersey, but it's definitely better than boring black and grey.<br /><br />Highly recommend.","2015-01-03"],["US",12868331,"R18L55A5H32I08","B00LWVDBV6",869890361,"iMeshbean® 8GB Mini Cam Pen HD Surveillance SPY Hidden Camera Camcorder Recorder DVR Video 1280x960 USA","Camera",3,1,2,"N","Y","Three Stars","It's an okay device","2015-01-03"],["US",31932134,"R1GY3ILM69K3FJ","B00HNX7AAA",875629418,"PAPAGO GoSafe Dashcam 2-Inch LCD (Black)","Camera",1,6,8,"N","Y","Serious Problem","Just discovered a serious problem.

The corners are cut to a different radius.<br />3) It doesn't appear to be adhered very strongly. If I hit the edges with my finger nail, it pops up easily, which can let in dust and leave air bubbles. Given the previous point about the corners, I worry that the corners are actually going to catch on things and pop up all the time.<br />4) The surface isn't very clear. It appears to me to be quite dull and covers/reduces the beautiful brilliance of the a5100 screen itself. Perhaps some might feel this is a 'feature' of the 'anti-glare' but the description should make it clear that it's going to dull the screen.<br /><br />My recommendation to the manufacturer: Pull this product from the mark and replace it with one without all of these defects.","2015-01-03"],["US",29144448,"R1Z8HK2D8VYFO8","B00HMZG3YS",567289788,"CamKix Case with Fully Customizable Interior for GoPro Hero 4/3+/3/2/1 and Accessories – Tailor the Case to Your Unique Needs - Ideal for Travel or Home Storage – CamKix&reg; Microfiber Cleaning Cloth Included","Camera",3,0,0,"N","Y","I'm glad I only paid $24","Not what I expected but it will do for now.

We live 500 miles away and I was concerned about being able to see regular updates of the baby, and the Frame definitely helps to allay those concerns.<br /><br />The frame was very easy to pair to the family account. A second frame lives with the other grandma. We also set up Playlists that are connected to each person's mobile phone so that they can easily send images to Nixplay. I emailed a bunch of images that I had taken at Christmas time to my own playlist on the Frame, though I had to downsize them to fit within the 8MB size limit. It was so cool to see them automatically appear shortly thereafter on the Frame.<br /><br />Each day when I turn on the Frame I look forward to the newest image of our darling grandchild.<br /><br />I am an avid photographer with over 11,000 images on flickr and was delighted to find that I could connect to the flickr album of baby images and add them to a Playlist. The Frame now cycles through all of my images, and ones from mom and dad and the other grandma. I did not have to downsize any of the images and e-mail them to the Frame. The only slight flaw with the process is that portrait oriented images (which display correctly on flickr) do not automatically rotate - they remain sideways, though you can manually rotate them using the nixplay remote control device.<br /><br />I would deduct a half of a star in my rating due to the awkward buttons on the back of the unit. In order to access the power button, menu or commands, you have to press one of 3 round buttons on the back of the unit. It would probably have helped if they were raised slightly or of different shapes. Nevertheless, the remote control is handy and allows you to access the most used commands.<br /><br />The Frame must always be connected to your wifi, and is not battery operated so must be placed near an electrical outlet and plugged in. A motion sensor located on the front shuts down the display after 30 minutes if there is no movement in the room.<br /><br />The website is easy to navigate, but for the most technologically challenged (such as an elderly grandparent or great-grandparent), it's best for someone else to set up the Frame and hand it over ready to go...<br /><br />The Frame has a nice feature set, and allows us to see a constantly updated set of images of our darling grand-daughter without having to e-mail or print anything!in.

Indoor accuracy was spotty once it synced (however this was expected since it relies on GPS technology).<br /><br />Second, it mounted to my Nikon above the built-in flash.

To activate the vertical shutter, go to the shooting menu, choose release mode and choose quick-release remote. To go back to using the horizontal shutter, simply go back to single frame or continuous mode, whichever one you normally use. It does feel a little on the light side but I'm fine with it. There is no pop out infrared button or cord to deal with. It's a nice grip! ..........Update, I am disappointed to find out there are no battery trays so it does not take AA batteries as a backup.","2015-01-03"],["US",31900963,"R14WFAXWY0L7X0","B00PC077H2",665789195,"TMEZON 1.0 Mega Pixel 720P HD-IP Weatherproof Outdoor Network ONVIF POE IP Security Surveillance Camera with IR Cut Day Night Vision Bullet for NVR System PoE Power Over Ethernet","Camera",4,8,9,"N","Y","Good value at the price but you get more by paying more for better cameras.","I took a chance on this because it is a tpsee camera board that uses UC2 software for video monitoring/recording and I already have 6 cameras that also use the same software.  It was nice to have an option on from whom to buy the cameras.  I bought this camera as a trial to see if I want to buy more from TMEZON and the jury is still out; I just haven't quite made up my mind.<br /><br />For security against external intruders, I recommend only using 720p in general locations where you're just looking more for just activity than for identification.  At all ingress and egress points, along with any other choke points that you know an intruder must pass, you should have 1080p at a minimum with 3MP or even 5MP preferable.  With higher resolution you have better hope of identifying an intruder to either recover your property or for prosecution.  That said, this, and most quality 720p IP cameras, will give a much better picture than almost all analog cameras.<br /><br />Since I had some general spaces I waned to watch besides just the doors and windows, I purchased one of these 720p cameras to try.  The video quality is very good, as has been my experience with any of the cameras based on the TopSee boards which use the TI 36x DaVinci series video processors.<br /><br />The IR/night vision is excellent, only limited by the number and intensity of the IR illuminators provided.  I'm using this camera up to about 20 feet with excellent results - which is no reflection on their promise of 20 meters IR coverage.  Of course my experience has been that effective IR range is about 1/3 of the promised &#34;detection&#34; range.  I just have not tried this camera beyond 20 feet.<br /><br />So, why only 4 stars instead of 5?  There are a few drawbacks with this camera.<br /><br />First, the lesser of the issues: there's no foam sealer provided in the mount.  I have bought a lot of outdoor cameras and all of them that had the cable in the mount (such that the mount covers the hole inthe wall so there's no exposed cable) have had a foam pad in the base to seal around the hole to protect the opening into the camera and the opening into your building.  This does not have it.<br /><br />Another issue, and the one that is really making me consider whether to buy more of these or not, is that this only does 20 frames per second at 720p.  This is the only 720p camera I know of with a 20 FPS limitation.  There are probably others but I just haven't seen that.  That may not be TMEZON's fault - it may be a limit on the board as shipped from tpsee.com - but it is a reflection on the camera, just the same.  This is the issue that has me hesitant to buy more of these.  I'm not saying I won't; I just have to consider what's more important: 30FPS or UC2 compatibility.<br /><br />Another problem with the camera is the lens.  It fisheyes, or curves, around the edges - again, I've never had an IP camera that did that.  It's not at all bad enough to make me not use the camera but it is noticeable.  Getting a better m12 megapixel lens wouldn't add more than a dollar or two to the cost of the camera.  Other TopSee cameras I have use a 3MP lens giving the same kind of fish-eye effect when using the 5MP mode.<br /><br />One option that tpsee.com offers on all of their board cameras that no one seems to put into a retail product is WIFI.  If TMEZON made a UC2 compatible cameras with WIFI, I'd be thrilled.  Also, I haven't seen any 1080p, 3MP, or 5MP cameras from TMEZON.  I hope they start selling them on Amazon soon.<br /><br />Other than those few little issues, the camera is pretty good.  If they offered WIFI I would buy more for sure.  If they fixed the lens problem, the FPS problem, and the rubber mount problem I would buy more for sure.  As it is, I guess I'll do more searching before I decide.","2015-01-03"],["US",52554070,"R1QU9UDTIBRK7R","B007J7J120",237703446,"Olympus Digital Camera TG-820 (Old Model)","Camera",5,0,0,"N","Y","Great Camera","This is a great camera. Waterproof, shock resistant, easy to use, lots of options, large view screen, great photos, good battery life. I bought this to use while snorkeling in Hawaii. The first time I used a waterproof case over my Canon 1400is. It was difficult to use becuase it was difficult to see the screen. This does not suffer from the same problems. The screen is easy to see even underwater. The controls are large enough to use even with light dive gloves. The beauty is that this camera goes from the air to under water and back againi and just works. I gotta say, it's really scary to just put the camera into the water but, it is fully waterproof. The only thing you need to do after a day at the beach is to rinse the camera in tap water to get rid of the salt and then dry it off.<br /><br />Suggestions: 1. Get a spare battery and battery charger. You can charge the battery while it's in the camera but while you're charging you can't use the camera. 2. Get the floatation strap; you don't want your camera to slip off your wrist and into 30' of water, 3. Get a small case for the camera. It's waterproof and shock resistant but there's no point in pressing the point. I got a small hard case for the camera so it is free of dust and protected from being banged around when I'm traveling (plus, there's room for the spare battery)","2015-01-03"],["US",17709844,"R1IMX8IU0UC966","B003ZHV70M",557875712,"Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Camera",5,0,1,"N","Y","Five Stars","My favorite toy!!!","2015-01-03"],["US",16957455,"R363YR6E4NUQ97","B00KH8QLFI",712743600,"Ritz Gear Premium HD MC Super Slim Lens Filter Set (UV, CPL, ND9, Warming) With SCHOTT OPTICAL GLASS","Camera",4,1,1,"N","N","Great glass, but no cloth!","The filters included in this kit are the CPL, neutral density, UV, and warming.

So I found these and can say that it works but what I don't like is that you'll have these pig tails hanging on your camera all the time.  Better than having the strap but not really the best setup.  So what I did is I put keychain wire circles, small ones about 1/2 inch in diameter and attached those to the camera where the straps normally are threaded, then I attached the swivel hooks to the straps and all is well; the nice thing about doing this is that you don't have those 3 inches pigtails hanging off the camera, a much cleaner / organized solution is the my jerry rig.  Of course you can just buy the rings and hooks at a hardware store but I wasn't able to find any in black, which I prefer, all I could find was silver.

I wasn't taking any photos because there was a fine hair or line of dust near the mirror that was showing up in every snap I took under brighter light conditions. I was extremely reluctant to clean the inside of the body, but knew I would have to either attempt it myself or have it professionally cleaned.  I priced cleaning the camera locally and realized I was looking at an $80 job minimum.  Scouting around on Amazon, I saw the Altura kit for my model digital SLR (a Nikon D80), and learned that there was also a handy cleaning tutorial on YouTube, courtesy the company. I took the plunge. Today, I cleaned my camera body and three lenses, including a fabulous older and neglected Sigma lens that was encased in dust, and they are all now good as new. I took some test shots at the sky and that hairline defect is gone. The lenses are as responsive as they were they day I got them, I even removed small dust particles and oil smears I didn't know were there, and the resulting images are crystal clear and sharp.  For nine dollars I have all my buddies back. So very happy. Thanks so much!

Requires more trial-and-error than a dedicated flash.  However, most dedicated flashes are large, bulky, and expensive and there are no compact dedicated flashes available for most compact cameras.<br />&#62; Using the &#34;slave mode&#34;, you can add an auxiliary flash to a compact camera which has a built-in flash, but does not have a hot shoe.<br />&#62; If your camera has a hot flash shoe, you can use the flash in manual mode, attached via the hot shoe, on the camera (with or without a built-in flash unit).<br />&#62; The flash works much better with alkaline batteries that it does with rechargeables. I suspect that voltage is the issue.***<br /><br />SIMPLE USE (e.g., with point-and-shoot cameras, or just in general)<br />&#62; As a generalization, the simple manual/slave flash unit can improve most flash photos taken with a &#34;point-and-shoot&#34; camera.  Not every situation, but often enough to be worthwhile trying.<br />&#62; If the built-in flash simply does not have the power (say for an indoor group photo), the extra light added by the Vivitar can usually improve the photo, even if you have no control of the aperture or ISO (as is the case with many simple point-and-shoot cameras).<br />&#62; Example:  Photos taken with an in-camera flash are usually flat.  But, if you hold a fill flash in your left hand high and to the left, you create modeling shadows which can greatly improve the photo.<br />&#62; In general, use as a fill flash is pretty much independent of whatever the camera is doing---you are just filling in shadows or brightening highlights, not really altering the main exposure---so it doesn't matter if the camera is a fully automatic point-and-shoot or not, as long as the in-camera flash fires to trigger the (fill) slave.<br /><br />GETTING BETTER PHOTOS<br />&#62; Unlike a dedicated flash unit, every flash of this manual/slave flash unit is full power.  The flash unit has no metering circuits (TTL or otherwise), and your camera will NOT adjust to the flash.  So, to get the best photos, you usually have to adjust your camera to the flash output.  Unfortunately, modern cameras resist such manual adjustment.  Even if you set the shutter speed and aperture manually, your camera will probably pump-up the ISO, defeating your efforts. So you also have to set the ISO manually.  (On some cameras you can’t actually set the ISO, but you can limit the range to a maximum ISO, which in effect is the same thing).<br />Details:<br />&#62; Your lens will probably be sharpest between f5.6 and f11.  The larger the number, the wider the depth-of-field.  Usually, you'll want a wide depth-of-field.  So, if possible, set your camera to manual or aperture-preferred, and the aperture at f8.<br />&#62; IMPORTANT: Set the ISO manually at 200, or a maximum ISO of 200.<br />&#62; Take a picture.  If the picture is too dark, you can increase the iso up to ~800.  If that isn't bright enough, then open your aperture to 5.6.  Alternatively, (in manual mode) you can set the shutter to a slower speed (say, down to 1/30 sec) to use more of the ambient light.<br />&#62; If ISO 200 at f8 (your aperture) results in a picture that is too bright, then reduce the ISO (if possible) and/or stop down the aperture to f11 or f16.  For portraits or closeup photography the easiest way to adjust the exposure is moving the flash unit closer or farther away from the subject.  The illumination is a logarithmic function of the distance, so a small difference (e.g., of 6&#34;) can make a big difference.<br />&#62; The formula for best flash photos (within reason) is maximum lighting with minimum (e.g.,f5.6--f16) aperture and minimum ISO (200 or less), and taken with a moderate telephoto lens (see below).<br />&#62; Let the flash fully recycle before taking another photo.  This flash recycles slowly, especially with used batteries.  Wait for the red ready light to come on and then wait at least another 5 seconds with fresh batteries, or at least 10 seconds with used batteries.<br />&#62; Assuming your camera has a built-in flash, often the best strategy for the best photos is to use the manual/slave flash as your main or key light, and the built-in flash to fill in any dark shadows.  That is usually easier said than done, and it may be hard to follow my explanation:  Even most point-and-shoot cameras have a brightness (“lighter/darker”) control.  If your are using the manual/slave flash as your key light (adjusting the exposure by ISO/aperture/distance)---then on some cameras, the “brightness” control may adjust the built-in flash exposure, which you can used to adjust the brightness of the fill light (in this case the built-in flash).<br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF THE FLASH<br />&#62; Very small (about 1&#34; x 2 3/8&#34; x 3 1/2&#34; overall, but looks smaller, and easily slips into a small space), very light (about 2oz w/o batteries) and compact.  Can easily be carried in a pocket, or in the accessory pouch of a camera bag.<br />&#62; In slave mode, you have a choice of 4 options, whether the unit syncs with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th flash of your in-camera flash.  These days most in-camera units flash 2 or more times for various reasons---but if you change your camera settings, that may change.  In most cases, most users will need to set the flash to &#34;2nd flash sync&#34; which is labeled &#34;S2&#34;.<br />&#62; You can use two or more such flash units if desired.  Indeed, you could have 3 or 4 scattered around a room on desk-top tripods.  For example [[ASIN:B00DESFDRU Vivitar VIVMPT100BLU 6-Inch Table Tripod (Blue)]], etc.<br /><br />A GREAT BRACKET ACCESSORY--------CHEAP<br />For $7 (reduced from $40) you can get a great 6&#34; extension, with a ball-head, and even a little base.  You can use the base as a table-top tripod to hold the flash.  Looks like it was made for the flash and bracket.

So with the same ISO and aperture, you can illuminate more people with a wide angle lens (or a zoom set wide).  However the result will look like a flat flash picture.  For a large group or a small room, you may have no choice than to use a wide angle lens, but if you can step back (without sacrificing too much in aperture or ISO), you'll get a better photo:<br />&#62; A &#34;normal&#34; lens (50mm in 35mm format; 25mm in 4/3rds format; etc) etc. corresponds closest to the view of the human eye, and therefore the brain translates 3D information from such a photo.  If illuminated by flash, a photo taken with a &#34;normal&#34; lens will have greater &#34;depth-of-illumination&#34; than the same photo taken with a wide angle lens, so the photo will have greater depth and look less like a flash picture.  Indeed, most pros have a (non-zoom) normal lens to take pictures of groups or children, etc.<br />&#62; A moderate telephoto (75-135mm in 35mm format; 40-70mm in 4/3rds format; etc) is best for portraits, babies, etc., and is pretty much essential for flash-illuminated portraits to be evenly illuminated.  That is, the depth-of-illumination will be even greater than with a normal lens.  Noses will appear smaller, and in general the photos will be more flattering.<br /><br />EVALUATION<br />&#62; At this price, this is obviously not a fancy, powerful, instant-recycling studio flash.  However, it is well built and works well, and does a good job of increasing the flash range of cameras withinadequate built-in flashes.<br /><br />*** If you use rechargeable batteries, the slave flash will become inconsistent after about 10-20 flashes---I think that's because the voltage drops too low.  Two fully charged rechargeables would be 1.2v + 1.2v = 2.4v, but the voltage might drop below 2v after a little use.  Two alkaline batteries start out at 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 volts, and would not drop below 2.4v unless the batteries were virtually dead.  Apparently the flash needs 2.3-2.4v to operate properly.

USING AS A FILL FLASH &#62; When you are using the slave flash only for fill, e.g., aimed at the ceiling, a reflector, a diffuser, or even backwards at the wall behind you, such that your in-camera flash (or other dedicated flash) is your main light source, then you can use the camera in auto-exposure mode, albeit I still recommend setting the aperture and ISO manually--the camera will then adjust the power output of your in-camera or dedicated flash.  The exposure computer in your camera is stingy with power---usually, it won't set your flash to maximum power unless you force it to.  The formula for best flash photos (within reason) is maximum lighting with minimum (e.g.,f5.6--f16) aperture and minimum ISO (200 or less), and taken with a moderate telephoto lens (see below).

The forward facing surface of the human body is rarely absolutely perpendicular to the ground.  Consequently, if you simply clip the Narrative Clip to your clothing, there is a good chance that the camera will not be facing directly forward and will instead be tilted at a slight angle.  As a result, you will only rarely obtain photos of what is directly in front of you.  Instead, you will obtain far too many photos of ceilings and trees and disembodied heads, and not nearly enough photos corresponding to what you actually saw in front of you during the course of the day.  I think the concept of the Narrative Clip is sufficiently worthwhile that I will keep on experimenting with different clip positions to see if this design flaw can somehow be overcome, but it's unfortunate that the designers of this product have not provided a solution to this basic problem.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>15798629</td><td>R2MJYPEBUH2XDR</td><td>B00NIYNUF2</td><td>985049339</td><td>GoPro CHDH-401 Black</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>GREAT</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>42693316</td><td>R3KHM8IHK0QXW8</td><td>B00HGLTCSC</td><td>2232344</td><td>PiuQ Professional Quick Release Camera Strap [Air Mesh Padded |Underarm Stabilizer] Single Shoulder Sling Belt fits Digital SLR/DSLR Camera, VideoCam</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Works well and has lots of adjustments.

It gets those 3 stars because the zoom capability is amazing.    However, the images are NOT clear.  The lens is cheaply made with spots of dark residue all over the metal and the weld points are horribly concealed.    Lets get to the image quality though, because I know that is what you want to know about.    Shots with this lens are meant to be taken in bright sunlight otherwise your shots will be terrible and you will have to resort to using a super high iso. I had to use 6400 constantly at high noon just to get standard lighting at the full 1000mm zoom.    I use a tripod and a wireless shutter release remote for shot with this and the images still manage to be blurry.    It is manual focus only which isn't bad and that is what I prefer, but even with a remote when you go to take a picture, the motion of the shutter closing is just enough wobble on the tripod to make the image blurry.    I'm past warranty so I can't take it back which sucks.    If you guys wish to contact me I'll supply photos taken with my D3200 using this lens if you wish to get an idea of what the quality actually is because I can't upload on amazon for some reason.

This camera is advertised as a great &#34;run'n'gun&#34; type of camera and I find that it functions extremely well for that type of use.  I have not yet used the SDi connection to record &#34;compression free&#34; (4-2-2) video, simply because thus far I am completely satisfied with the quality I get recording directly to the SD flash cards.  I always use an external mic, so I cannot comment on the quality of the internal mic audio.  I have found myself using the auto functions most of the time, and have been very satisfied with the quality, I just have not found a need to use the manual settings all that much, but when I do, they are easy to manipulate.  However, I do use a polarizing filter quite often and on occasion, external lighting.  I do not plan on getting into the &#34;4K&#34; realm yet, and likely will not in the foreseeable future, I am that pleased with this camera and the video I can get from it.  I will likely get its &#34;smaller cousin,&#34; the XA20, as a second and/or backup (or maybe third) video camera before I go 4K, if I ever go 4K.

So overall not the best  but I feel I got my moneys worth.  if you use your projector a lot 250 hours could go very quickly.  Also to note I did NOT clean my projectors filters  ( I think you are supposed to vacuum the intake) which I guess I should do more often. It seems these thing die from high heat.  I put the projector on the medium setting for brightness then adjusted it recently to the high setting for brightness that is what seemed to kill the bulb. but I  wish i remembered to vacuum the intake filters more often.  Im sure it was a a M-Wave company replacement because I kept the receipt.  They say the company was started in 1989 so I figured If i had to replace the bulb at least they would take it back int eh 150 warranty period.  I did not have to do that but I i did only get 250 hours out of the bulb and only about 3-4 hours at the end if its life on the &#34;high&#34; brightness setting.  Now the replacement is only like $65  At least with this review you get my experience with the bulb.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4189432</td><td>R9P156GOZI9BW</td><td>B00L43MQSG</td><td>936272257</td><td>CamKix Telescopic Pole for Gopro Hero 4, Session, Black, Silver, Hero+ LCD, 3+, 3, 2, 1 and Cameras - Adjustable - Remote Straps - Easy Extension – Tripod Mount / Wrist Strap / Lanyard</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>nice price. worth it</td><td>Really easy to use and great length fully extended as well as unextended.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>16340336</td><td>RQ1R1E3E1RLFO</td><td>B00BP5YUX2</td><td>99829480</td><td>SmallRig Aluminum Alloy Camera Video Cage for Canon EOS C100</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great Handles!</td><td>Solid.

The quality isn't the best, but you're paying for portability and fun. I'm a wedding photographer and my clients LOVE the little prints I can share with them the same day. Get it if instating sharing/memory making is top priority over quality prints.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars? I accidentally opened the printers back cover while the printer was in. This was a HUGE and costly accident. My printer is now unable to turn on, opening the back cover while powered on totally killed the printer. The back cover should not be so easily opened while operating. I think that's a design flaw, especially when opening the printer kills it. I called Fujifilm and their rep told me to basically send it back to the store I purchased it from or send it in to their service shop in NJ. There is NO way to reset the printer myself. I'm very disappointed in Fujifilms response to this matter.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13016623</td><td>R170HOZ932KHQS</td><td>B0031RGGAM</td><td>921370584</td><td>Kodak Slice</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Decent Pics</td><td>Takes decent pictures...Easy to use</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>6215457</td><td>R1LEVG049F9XYN</td><td>B00MNT30ZI</td><td>404383105</td><td>(Create a generic Title per Amazons guidelines)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Saved me from a lot of disappointment when my camera ran out of power during our ...</td><td>Having a spare battery is a must!

I tried the Lee kit for the 14-24 and it's a pain to use and overpriced as well.  Not to mention another set of even larger filters to lug around.<br /><br />Sharpness is good with a very slight blurring at the edges.  With all my wide angles usually I shoot landscape or travel shots.  I'm always on a tripod, mirror up mode, f/16-f/20 and a shutter release so I'm sure I'll get the sharpest images.  Given that, I don't care that it's not f/2.8.  Test shots with D810 worked well for me so I'll be keeping this in my bag.

Now i know for some using the back button focus then easing down the shutter to engage the V.C  then snapping the photo will be no problem but for me it was so i had to go back to normal shutter operation to make it work for me.  and that is the only issue i have run across</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>5246766</td><td>R2BSZSXACS2ZXZ</td><td>B00BS4KUCK</td><td>67722115</td><td>DJI Phantom Prop Guards for Phantom 1 and FC40 (Set of 4)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great for training.</td><td>These are perfect for training.

Based on reviews, I bought this one.  Here's the deal: the set up instructions are minimalist.  You turn on the device, connect it to wifi, and it provides a code that you enter into a web page to create an account with Nixplay.  So far so good. But how do you get pictures onto it?  It is impossible to figure this out without watching the Nixplay tutorials.  The tutorials are pretty good, but we couldn't find any written version of the instructions. The Quick Start instructions should have had bold letters: WATCH THE TUTORIAL VIDEOS!!!  Would have saved some heartache.<br /><br />The web site was very flaky on a Mac Powerbook (Safari).  We had to use a Chromebook to set up the account and repeatedly reload the Powerbook web page to make it work.  Strange, but eventually it did work.<br /><br />The unit also arrived with a single bad pixel, in the lower left.  It is not noticeable with lighter color photos, but on anything dark it stands out like a beacon.  Very annoying, but not quite worth packing it all up and returning it. Ding two stars for poor QA.<br /><br />All said and done, the thing I like about this is you can email pics to the photo frame (after you configure the email settings on the web site). Shoot on your phone, email, wait a few minutes. Done. That's pretty cool.

I was very disappointed with the results.  Now I am working on my old slides and have discovered that the only thing I am going to be able to use it for is to &#34;Fast Scan&#34; all my slides and organize them as I go.  This is great for &#34;Fast Scanning&#34; and was worth the price to me just for that purpose.  I was used to having to place 2 slides into my scanner and scan, then replace those with 2 more and scan again.  Anyone having done this knows how slow this goes.  I love the fact that I can scan all my slides quickly and not worry about the quality.  The quality of many of my old slides has decreased quite a bit over the years anyway, so after scanning them, I'll choose which ones to try to restore.  Bottom line is this machine was helpful to me for fast scanning and organizing of slides only.  I probably would not have attempted this project without it.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>51233855</td><td>R11CBYD1XO925P</td><td>B00HLBLF3W</td><td>755355786</td><td>NEEWER Optical 8-Point Star Cross Filter Twinkle Effect for Digital Camera Lens (77MM)</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Decent effect - not adjustable as higher quality filters are</td><td>I ordered this 8-point star cross filter and also a 4-point star cross filter made by someone else.

You can accomplish that with this one, but you run the risk of either the filter dropping off, or blackened edges to your frame if shooting a real wide angle lens.

If the user is a hobbyist then by all means save a few bucks.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13222183</td><td>R1OR62AEW06PKV</td><td>B002C76W4C</td><td>768631708</td><td>Studiohut Hot Shoe Three Axis Double Bubble Level</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>good level</td><td>doesn't fit the older sonys hot shoe but can buy an adaptor( if you don't have one already) for the price it's a good level</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>27555921</td><td>R26T8SIOXNB9UE</td><td>B00HNJWWK2</td><td>206314741</td><td>Sony Video Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>I love it</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13681273</td><td>R2BSD521VC1ZVB</td><td>B004K34MUC</td><td>525806751</td><td>Olympus XZ-1 Digital Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Olympus XZ</td><td>This is my second Olympus XZ.

The setup was really easy. I did the initial setup through the Pyle IP Cam app. on my android phone. The hardest part was to figure out where to mount the camera.

The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to connect my desktop remotely. I have e-mailed Pyle to see if they can tell me how to set this up. I will update my review when I accomplish this. I would recommend this camera for the price you can't go wrong. I plan on purchasing another camera soon.  After having this camera installed for 3 weeks the picture went blurry and there is no night vision at all. I did get an e-mail back from Pyle after waiting a week and the told me to set up DDNS just follow the instructions to view the camera remotely or use Ivideon or Ispy which I tried to do but couldn't get it to show my camera. Their instruction manual is not written for a person that doesn't know how to do this. I e-mailed them again in regards to the blurry image and no night vision but still have not received a e-mail back it's been 3 days. The camera will be returned.

I did not see this adapter mentioned in the product description.

The tripod was not received in one piece as described. All the legs and center column were in separate plastic bags. It wasn’t difficult to figure out how to put it together.<br /><br />One leg would extend but only after pulling it very hard (did unlock the leg before extending). Trying to retract the leg took much effort since it was stuck (leg was unlocked).  After retracting it, trying to extend it was just as bad.  When attaching one of the legs to the center section to make it into a monopod resulted in the finished product being crooked.  Appears the threading (used to screw one section into the other) was manufactured incorrectly (not straight) thus the section at the union resulted in being crooked.<br /><br />Releasing the “quick” release plate is not so quick.  The quick release section needs a better design.  Not practical to use.  Good thing I found out about all the problems before discovering them during actual use.  I don’t recommend this product.  Have asked Amazon to return this product.  In Amazon's always great service, received an immediate approval for return.

This seems way overpriced for me, when the book &#34;Poor Man's Picture Gallery&#34; (a beautiful, massive hardcover book with hundreds of stereoscope images, which comes with this exact same OWL viewer) is only $5.00 more.  Also, I just think $30.00 is too much for this viewer.  It is plastic, not very attractive (not ugly, but certainly not something you'd show off like a wood stereoscope), and I found it just didn't work with every stereo card.  Granted, it worked fine on most cards, if you take time to properly adjust it.  But the length it is capable of telescoping for focus is just a few inches, and on some cards there just was no point where the card came into focus for me.  I could tell if it had a little more length to stretch, it would work.  So I feel it's an imperfect viewer.  Another thing is, the tabs that are supposed to hold it together, don't fit well.  I own three of these now (since they come with all Brian May's books) and this is the case with each. They pop right back out.  Also, for me, the viewer never seems to be in focus, it causes back and neck aches in no time, due to the fact that you have to lay it on the image and then lean down to look into it, and is cumbersome to adjust up & down.  Overall, not a very good viewer,  in my humble opinion anyway.  I know that's heresy for many ... to speak ill of a product from the great Brian May.  But seriously - pick up a Loreo paper viewer for $2.95 and use that for viewing images in books.  Or if you want to spend the money, buy a Pokescope.  And Brian - if you're reading this, I'm sorry, and I do love you!</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1878006</td><td>R3RXLACMNQLYT2</td><td>B001CADR0W</td><td>656270993</td><td>Nikon SD-9 Hi-Performance Battery Pack for SB-910 and SB-900 and SB-5000 Speedlight Flashes</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Very Useful!</td><td>Very useful adjunct to my Nikon SB-900.

The mirrorless cameras are cool because they are inexpensive and light weight.  Anyway......Previously I had a kit lens that came with my backup Sony NEX 5 camera.  The range of that lens is 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 so it lacks telephoto capabilities and it is a bit slow at the top end (F5.6). I bought this lens because it is fairly fast at F4 and when the cropping factor of 1.5x is taken into account, it includes a decent telephoto range at 152mm.<br /><br />So far I have tested the lens in low light, bright light and shooting fast moving kids opening gifts at Christmas.  I have also had the chance to test the on board flash and the video.  I am not much of a video expert but my limited testing came up with some nice low light footage and the auto focus and power zoom worked perfectly.  The clarity of the lens seems good and I am actually quite surprised at the overall quality of the lens and the results I get using this lens.  I am used to paying much more for high end lenses for my Nikon DSLR but this lens seems to have very good quality.  If things change, I will update the review but so far I am very pleased with this lens.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>39587552</td><td>R14EBAYYPXEUQY</td><td>B00IFCOM9K</td><td>760547679</td><td>COOLPIX P600 16.1MP Digital Camera Black Kit Includes camera, memory card, bag, battery charger, batteries, card reader, cleaning kit and mini tripod</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Perfect came right away</td><td>Bought for my college age kids for Christmas they have a new hobby now . .  .

The navigation wheel on the battery grip, when used to move the focus point, has started scrolling vertically continuously when pressed. To stop it you have to hit the main body navigation wheel. It's basically useless now.  I first contacted Eachshot, who provided a canned response of not being able to help and saying &#34;All response in accordance with Amazon's policy. For more questions, you can contact Amazon directly.&#34; When I contacted Amazon they directed me to their fraud group (?) when I was asking for a working replacement, because the product is not 6 months old. Amazon said the purchase was over 30 days old and could do nothing (UPDATE: Amazon has finally refunded me the cost of this faulty product). I emailed Meike support and did not receive a response.  Really a lousy all-around experience, from each party involved. I won't purchase a product from Eachshot or Meike again. It's unfortunate that my rating of this product drops from a 5-star to an $85 worthless 1-star.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just received this and wanted to make a few notes for others.  First, it's very easy to install. It doesn't pop in, you turn the &#34;Lock&#34; nob and it pulls itself onto the D750 body. It fits VERY well, no gaps and clearly well designed.  There's the power button specific to the battery grip you must turn on. The main and sub-dials work very well, and the grip texture is excellent. The option wheel/nob is probably the only lacking item on this grip. It's a bit difficult to hit the center (100% viewable) but it's far from a reason not to purchase.  I also want to mention if you want to use the AF-L/AE-L button on the battery grip for other than that option, you must set it separately in camera. I use this button for AF-ON and couldn't figure outwhy the camera body was set for this, but the grip wasn't. Anyhow on the menu this can be found at &#34;Custom Settings Menu -&#62; Controls -&#62; f10 Assign MB-D16 AE-L/AF-L button&#34;, then choose what you would like to use it for.  Really an excellent buy compared to the outrageous price Nikon charges.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>49339495</td><td>R398DE4DCS7QH4</td><td>B00FXYTLIK</td><td>543718314</td><td>Nikon 27126 EN-EL 14A Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery (Grey)</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>good.</td><td>As expected, works great.

One for me and one for my wife.  We are both photographers and we primarily shoot Nikon DSLR cameras but like Sony mirrorless cameras because they are light weight and are good backup cameras. Prior to this purchase we were using Sony NEX 5 cameras as our backup cameras but we weren't happy with the limited bracketing capabilities, i.e. 1/3 Fstop with only 3 shots in the bracket set.  That essentially made the cameras worthless for HDR shooting when high dynamic scenes were involved.  Another photographer friend bought one of these and sang its praises to me before Christmas.  I did a lot of research and the 11 frames per second, 25k ISO, view finder and the super auto focus got my attention. We already had Sony E-Mount lenses so I bought two A6000 bodies.<br /><br />So far we are loving these cameras and have already taken several pictures with different light levels. The processed images are beautiful and the onboard stabilization seem to work quite well.  They camera seems to be noise free up to about 3200 ISO.  More testing will be necessary but so far this inexpensive camera is very impressive.  A negative is that they didn't provide a 110/12volt charger.  Because of the low price and many nice features, it appears that Sony cut corners by eliminating the chargers.  We already had ours from our NEX 5 cameras so it isn't a big deal.  That brings up another nice benefit.  This camera uses the same batteries as the NEX 5 cameras. As for charging, they do provide a USB charging cable that requires charging to be done with the battery in the camera. This is a slow process but it works.  If you by this camera, I suggest you buy a separate charger and a few extra batteries.  They are inexpensive and will allow you to quickly charge your batteries.  I hope this information is helpful.  So far we really like these cameras and we are experienced photographers.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>37070707</td><td>R2A5Z7PEVMTY8Y</td><td>B00L8B5HPS</td><td>361183050</td><td>Ultimate Accessory Kit for Nikon Coolpix L840, L830, L820, L810, L620, L610, L330, L320, L310, L30, L28, L26, L120, L110, L105, L100 Digital Cameras Includes 4 AA High Capacity 3100mAh Rechargeable Batteries with Quick AC/DC Charger + 32GB High Speed Memory Card + Universal Card Reader + Water Resistant Padded Case + Full Size Pro 60 Inch Tripod + Mini Table Tripod + Memory Case Holder + Screen Pr</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Accessories not required....</td><td>The camera did not meet our expectations.

I awarded a 4 star rating only because for 5 stars, I'd want the lens to be a little sharper at f2.8, not that it's soft there, it's very good and I don't hesitate to use it at 2.8, but it isn't excellent wide open, so it gets 4 stars. But it is a very sharp lens.  It's sharper than the 24-105, hands down, but IS is very nice; however, keep the shutter speed up: 1/500+.  Handheld, I don't get as many keepers at, say, 1/250sec, and am much more confident of getting the shot if I'm at least at 1/500, but safer still at 1/640.  Might mean using a little higher ISO than you are used to - maybe ISO 400 - but on a full frame body, this isn't much of an issue.  Monopod was no help.  The 135mm f2 is only a little shorter, yet I can handhold that lens at significantly lower shutter speeds.  Now that is a 5/5 lens.  I'm currently in Bali, giving the new lens a workout in the field.  I must say, though, that I spent a fair bit of time familiarising myself with this lens before traveling, particularly because of the shutter speed issue.  I have had to train myself to be constantly aware of shutter speed and my general stance and shooting technique, which is not completely new to me, just more so with this length lens.  But we are performing very well indeed and snapping some great shots, I think.  I'm glad I put the preparation into this lens before traveling.  My other companion on this trip is the 24-70 f2.8 mk II.  Another stellar lens.  They are a good travel kit, but if I had to take just one, it would be the 24-70 for its versatility.  It tolerates some heavy cropping with the 6D, so I can always pretend I was closer than I was.  Update:  Did I say I'd choose the 24-70 f2.8 mkii to travel with? Got back from Bali having shot the 200mm most of the trip.  Lots more.  Love being able to stand back and love the potential for out of focus background.  And love it's size and weight. Got some great shots with the 24-70, and if I'd been travelling with kids or friends, I'd have used it a lot more, but for what I like to shoot, the 200 was the one. The lack of IS still means more duds, but I'm pretty good now and with a few extras to choose from, not a big issue.  Update #2:  The lens is about a year old now and is almost always in the bag along with the 24-70 II ... a 70-200 zoom doesn't fit into my bag! Well, guess I could make it fit but clumsily.  Still highly recommend this lens for all kinds of situations, not just travel.  Out of the house, I use it all the time.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>11636014</td><td>RC9FH28RSUZEM</td><td>B008DRA18I</td><td>685372637</td><td>SVP ™ 18 Megapixel Digital Camera Series</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Very nice for the price!</td><td>Saw where some people complained about the picture quality.

It's a Sony, it's got a Carl Zeiss Tessar Lens, it is 11.9 MP sensor, is small and water resistant to 5m.    Took it on holiday with the kids and got pictures of them in the pool and at the water park, and they're quite tickled to see them.  Generally pleased with the purchase.    The camera itself is a rounded body with buttons on the rear and on one side.  The base has a cover which extends from the front to the rear of the camera and houses the various connectors.  The rear opens to expose the memory card and battery compartment.    The memory card gave me some problems initially with the screen flashing on insertion of the card.  This is caused either by the card being inserted in the wrong direction (there are small markings on the cover - one direction for Micro SD and another for Memory Stick),  or the formatting of the card.  A brand new card would not work for me until I removed all the partitions - I did this using my Linux PC and running gparted.    Once the memory card was recognised, the camera worked flawlessly.  It can take photos, videos and interval shots.    Some points to note:    + Without the plastic waterproof case, the camera has no thread mount for a tripod.  Due to its rounded base, it also cannot stand upright without this case.  So the plastic water resistant case is quite necessary.  The front of the case holds the camera in position.    + If you bring the camera enclosed in the case from an air-conditioned room to the beach or pool, you may get condensation forming on the inside of the case as the camera gets warm during operation.    + When connected to Sony's \\\\\"Play Memories Mobile\\\\\", your smartphone can act as viewfinder allowing you remote control of the camera.  You can view pictures but not playback video.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>10838767</td><td>R9AFF3A1NNTA6</td><td>B00OGRQXJU</td><td>803097259</td><td>Syma X5C Quadcopter Drone with HD Camera and extra battery in exclusive Blue design</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>pretty durable and sturdy</td><td>Bought this for my husband and he's obsessed with it!!

You can purchase a RF-602 TX or RF-603TX and trigger the flashes wirelessly.. until now, this has been a nice little bonus but with the YN560TX, it adds the ability to remotely change the power levels of the flashes from the camera itself (opposed to just sending a trigger signal). This is a great feature, one usually reserved for higher-cost ETTL models.<br /><br />A few nice features on it:<br /><br />* The YN560TX can pair up to 6 groups. You can have an A, B, C, D, E, F group and adjust each light separately.. If you assign 2 flashes to an &#34;A&#34; group, changing that setting on the YN560TX will change it on all &#34;A&#34; group flashes.<br />* You can set the YN560TX to either RF602 or RF603 and 16 different channels each -- if you have an older flash (like a YN560II) you will need a RF602 or RF603 receiver to trigger the flash (Note: the wireless control will not work on YN560 or YN560II -- you need the 560III or newer). It will only trigger a RF602/603.<br />* If you change the power with the YN560TX, you can also trigger those flashes with a RF602/RF603 transmitter set to the same channel (EX: Using 2 cameras one with a YN560TX and one with a RF602/RF603)<br /><br />On to the product -- it's a nice design - it looks like someone cut a YN560 in half and took off the flash head -- even down to the red front cover (which appears to be functionless/decoration-only?)<br />Construction is solid, buttons are good and it has a good viewing angle/backlight (green)<br /><br />Setup is a bit tricky as there are 4 buttons, a TEST light, up/down/left/right/center and an on-off switch.. this means lots of holding multiple buttons at once to set features. For example, hold MODE+HZ/FN to change from RF602 to RF603.. A lot of these aren't very clear, and if in the field and needing to &#34;fix&#34; something, can be quite a challenge (even with the instruction manual, due to the way it's written). A nicer method would have been to have a &#34;Settings&#34; menu to change these rather than button presses (pressing 1 button, holding the same button, and holding the same button + another button all product different features).<br /><br />The hotshoe is metal ad has a locking/twist mechanism which is nice. The item's lightweight, even with batteries.. but it's pretty bulky (not deducting points for, since a lot of that is due to the screen size and buttons), but it's worth noting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where I started to discover some problems were with it being somewhat unreliable when using multiple -- I picked up 3 of these to use with 3 different cameras. You CAN use multiple together, but settings don't always send the way you'd like them to. For example I'll call these 560TX-A and 560TX-B<br />If 560TX-A is set to 1/1 power on channel A and 560TX-B is set to 1/4 power on channel A, the one which was set LAST takes priority. If you want the 2nd transmitters' settings to send, you need to use the &#34;Group&#34; button to highlight the channel (EX: &#34;A&#34;) for about 2 seconds for it to send that signal. If using 1 channel, it's not bad.. if using 3, 4, 5 or 6 it's kind of annoying. I bought this thinking it sent the &#34;power level&#34; signal when it transmitted the &#34;Flash&#34; signal, which is not the case.<br /><br />My other gripe was that it was hit or miss, even at close distances (~5 feet). With fresh batteries in a brand new YN560III and in the YN560TX, I would have some flashes failing to &#34;flash&#34; every few shots.. Trying with a RF602 transmitter, the problem went away. I don't know why it does this, and it would alternate between flashes that wouldn't fire (the flashes were recharged, on a lower level (not overheating) and tried with multiplesets of new batteries in each and different YN560TX's). Outdoors seemed to work better, howeversets of new batteries in each and different YN560TX's).

I discovered what the issues were by contacting the Q-See tech support.  If you are familiar with port forwarding your installation will be a little easier. I rate this a 4 instead of a 5 for the following reasons. 1. The website camera will go offline every now and then.  2. The infra red camera images are not clear after about 15 feet (you can detect movement but images are blurry. make sure you point the camera to an area that is lighted or will get light from your flood lights, which I eventually did.)<br /><br />My overall assessment of this product is good for the money. You may have to drill some holes to attach the camera and power wires to the video security system. I have a 2400 square foot home and the system using 5 camera's cover about 80 percent of the exterior. I use three cameras the cover my front living room, my garage entrance to the interior to the home, and to the rear deck door area.<br /><br />One other point; I use this item in conjunction with my monitored security system, barred sliding glad doors. 4 motion detectors, and glass break detectors on each window. The area in which I love is not consider a high crime area, but we do experience breaking and entering with a raise in property theif. If you use this system in conjunction with other deterrents I am sure you will be very comfortable with your overall security.  I hope this helps.  My wife just told me she feels safer because see can monitor the system on her cell phone while she is in bed watching TV.

I bought this Nikon to take on a European trip. This camera is pretty standard for a point and shoot. I do like the extended zoom and all the little bells and whistles. I really hate the pop up flash, it is quite annoying. Most of my photos didn't require a flash so it was quite easy to turn off. It is also easy to edit the photos. I used a very fast card in the camera. The card and battery are easy to remove. One thing missing from these type of cameras is a viewfinder. I did purchase an extra battery. Another thing missing is a separate battery charger, but Nikon  includes a cord to charge the battery while in the phone. I don't like that feature at all. It was quite easy to sync the camera with my wireless router  transfer and post photos online. However, there is no manual included, everything is online. Nikon has an app for that, just saying. I would have given this camera more stars if it wasn't for the pop up flash design.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>40614475</td><td>RBBIN5XL589I3</td><td>B002N5CV8Y</td><td>530260828</td><td>Manfrotto 494RC2 Ball Head with Quick Release Replaces Manfrotto 484RC2</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Nice equipment.</td><td>Nice equipment to add to my new Manfrotto MT055XPRO3 055 Aluminium.

I'm very impressed with this product as its made very well and looks and wears great. I'm a bigger guy with a slightly bigger head (yea I said that), and this thing gives me plenty of room and wears very comfortable. The elastic and stitching is done very well and the plastic pieces are not flimsy or hallow feeling. I also enjoy the blue thumb screw as an added bonus of color to the piece as all my other thumb screws are plain black.

HOWEVER, this camera came with a 1- year warranty and only lasted several months before it no longer turned on. sakar/vivitar lied to me and gave me the run-around, telling me to call this person and that person and that someone would call me back after so long. i waited weeks at a time for people to call me back. this kept up until i was after the one year mark. when i finally was directed to the right person, my warranty was over. at that point, they REFUSED to help me. they did that on purpose so that they did not have to reimburse me or replace my camera. i went to best buy and bought a great Sony camera that is soooo much better and then sakar/vivitar finally sent me a replacement in the mail-but only because before i bought my new camera i had told a little fib to sakar/vivitar that because they purposely delayed speaking to me until they had ran me out of time on my warranty, i would be cancelling a $300 purchase. the truth is, there was no other purchase and i will NEVER be buying from this company again.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>31869789</td><td>RSMXKVSZB4I1E</td><td>B00FGHODK0</td><td>672216551</td><td>Micca Neo-Series 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with Ultra Slim Design (M709A)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Well Worth the Money!!!!</td><td>Honestly, I can't say enough about this product to do it justice.<br />I got this as a present for my parents. I'll say right off the bat the controls/menu navigation is not user-friendly but what it lacks there it makes up for where it counts. I did a lot of research on digital frames. I found there are fantastic frames available for at least double the price. The more expensive devices allow one to sync with other devices, communicate with social media, maybe even make you breakfast-who knows.... Many of these have a viewing ratio similar to the new TV'S out now (widescreen)  while this looks nice, most pictures are still 4:3 (standard portrait-type pictures). This means there'll either be unused space on the display or pictures will be stretched/compressed making the pictures look horrible. Another issue I discovered on more expensive models is the poor viewing angle. The 15&#34; Micca is very plain but the pictures look fantastic! The viewing angle is incredible. I walked all over a large room after setting up the device and the pictures looked amazing from everywhere in the room.<br />The stand is cheap but functional. There are mounting holes allowing the device to be mounted on a wall. It has an SD card slot and a USB port (it ships with an 8GB SD card). It also comes with a remote which I found essential to navigating the menu because the buttons were difficult to use while trying to watch the screen.<br />In short, this device is well worth the money (I got it on Amazon for about $100...a little over that, don't remember). It won't win awards for Human Factors engineering but if you simply want a digital portrait displaying your photos amazingly well then get this one!!!!<br />I'm not adding review details about the music player or calendar functions because my parents had no interest in that aspect of the device, apologies.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>34180756</td><td>R2WLBT074SDNDZ</td><td>B006Y0YZZ6</td><td>670151863</td><td>Photive Original LP-E8 Ultra High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Canon T2i and T3i (Canon LP-E8 Replacement)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>They work very good with my Canon camera.

She loves it.  I preloaded 200 pictures to the web, added family members that can email new pictures to the web, and tested the automated email web upload.  Everything worked fine.  There were a number of web site delays and disconnects but this was during December, thus could have been a surge of new customers hitting the servers.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because of some software glitches described below.  But I'm fairly confident these will be addressed over time.<br /><br />Specific comments on some of the features:<br />The ability to load pictures to the web, or send pictures via email, to a distant relative's frame is awesome!  This is a great gift for distant relatives or friends, and for someone who isn't technical, giving them an easy way to receive and display photos.<br /><br />I like the ability to manage settings via the frame or via the web.  But there is one glitch I found with this, which will hopefully be corrected with software updates.  The sizing option ' fit to frame' works when selected via the frame settings, but does not work when selected via the web settings. I bought both the 12 inch and 8 inch frame.  Now I'm not sure if the issue was only on the 12 inch or both (I don't have the 8 inch with me to test anymore).  The alternate sizing option of 'fill the frame' is not useful for many of my photos, it cuts off the full photo and rolls around the photo while displaying.  Using 'fit to frame' is the solution.  As a result of these two issues I needed to have my mothers frame set to local settings rather than web, which is hard because she is not tech savvy and changing the settings in the future is not something she can manage.<br /><br />The option to set what time the frame 'sleeps, will override the user turning off the frame.  I set it for midnight-8 am, then sometime during the day I turned off the frame.  Within 30 minutes the frame turns itself back on. Once I disabled the sleep interval the frame will stay off when I turn it off.  The user turning off the frame should override the sleep time in the settings.  The settings time should merely be a fallback to ensure it is turned off if the user left it on.<br /><br />I have the two frames being managed in my single account, very nice to have one account for both.  I'm able to assign different playlists to the two frames, using the same source of picture albums loaded on the web.  The one issue is that emailed photos are assigned to a single playlist I configure.  A better solution would be for Nixplay to read the email subject line and assign a playlist based on the subject line.  In other words, have user configurable settings on the web where I assign a key word to each playlist and tell family members these key words that they can use in their email subject line, which tells Nixplay which playlist to put the picture in.  Include a default so that if the email subject line doesn't contain any keywords it will go to a default playlist. That way if I don't want the emailed picture to go to both frames I can have it automatically managed by playlist selection in the email subject line.<br /><br />The order of the playlists can be changed for each frame. A nice feature.  I made a playlist for emailed photos that precedes the other albums. The order of the pictures in the playlists can also be changed and rearranged, BUT it's glitchy.  I drag a picture to a new location in the list and drop it, but it shows up somewhere else when I look through the pictures on line.  I eventually figured out that as I dragged it I needed to look for the ghost of the picture, instead of where my cursor was at, even then it was hard to find the ghost to land it in the correct position.  This is a good feature, but needs to be improved.  It might be an issue based on which web browser is being used or which version of web browser?<br /><br />I have not found a way to play all folders on the USB stick automatically.  I can only select a folder or sub-folder and play all pictures in the folder.  I'd like a way to select a folder and have a slideshow of all pictures in that folder and any sub folders.  As well as a way to select the memory card or USB and play all pictures in all folders on that storage medium.  Though the menu option implies 'all photos', it only selects all photos in that folder or not in any folders, but will not select photos in other folders or sub folders.<br /><br />It would also be nice to have more slideshow transition options.  But not a big deal to not have them.<br /><br />The display itself and picture quality is great, I have no complaints.  At severe angles the picture is no longer viewable, which is normal for this type of display technology.<br /><br />Some folks have complained about the USB sticking out from behind the 8 inch frame, I purchased a micro USB stick and don't have that issue at all.<br /><br />I don't mind no touch screen, as others have commented it's better to not have the finger smudges on the frame.  The remote works great and works from 3 to 5 feet away for me.  My vision to see what I'm selecting is more an issue than the remote distance lol.<br /><br />The USB stick gets quite hot.  I don't know whether that will turn out to be an issue or not.<br /><br />The remote button labeled 'back' doesn't go back to the prior screen.  It goes to the menu, which is a pain when working with multiple folders on the storage devices. This should be corrected as a software glitch.<br /><br />The option to display the time along with the photos is nice, but the time display is way to large, covering too much of the photo.  It should be smaller or perhaps make it vertical instead of horizontal.<br /><br />Overall I'm quite happy with both frames, I have recommended them to friends, and my mom loves it ( except when I tried to talk her through turning on the 'over ride web settings' option - ah, another improvement could be to add this option to the web settings so I could have enabled that for her from the web).  All glitches I found can be corrected via software or firmware updates and this company appears to have a solid history of paying attention to feedback and working through any software issue found, as well as making steady improvements in their feature set both on the web and on the frames.and play all pictures in the folder.

My husband and I ordered them and it was a hot mess. I knew they weren't wireless, but unless you want to deal with an incredible amount of cords, don't buy it. Here are some major problems I had with it:<br /><br />1. The instructions made absolutely NO sense (even for my dad who's typically great with these sorts of things). In one section it said the DVR would have a red light when on, and then later was contradicted by saying the light should be green. There was no &#34;power&#34; button on the DVR that the instructions kept referring to. When we finally got it hooked up to the TV, the screen would come on for a few seconds and go off. The instructions were confusing because there barely were any. It left us with more questions than answers. It real didn't tell us how to do anything.<br />2. The amount of cords for these cameras is INSANE! It was quite overwhelming seeing the whopping amount of cords that came with it. Even with the cords being so long, and our house being rather small, it was difficult to connect everything we needed to. There were zillions of things to connect.<br /><br />OK really I guess that's it. That's as far as we got before we boxed it up and shipped it right on back to where it came from. If I were you, I'd look into Lorex wireless cameras. They are a little more expensive, but worth it considering they are great quality and no hassle!!</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>23471704</td><td>R34S6NG4OSRZV5</td><td>B00KKUI4I0</td><td>264417064</td><td>Camera Strap - Soft Padded Black Neoprene Lightweight Adjustable Comfortable Designer Sling for Your Valued Canon Nikon Pentax Sony DSLR - Anti-Slip - For Guys & Women - Quick Release Design</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Good strap</td><td>I've had a chance to use this strap on a few occasions and after getting used to the fact that the camera is upside down the strap is very comfortable.

My second purchase was the 679B monopod w/ 234RC head. As my photography needs changed, I turned to the Manfrotto line once again with the purchase of the 190XPROB tripod legs.<br /><br />The center post / arm is excellent for getting a nice steady support that's low to the ground making it perfect for macro work. I'm still using the 390RC2 head from my original purchase and love the interchangeability of the Manfrotto components. Also, with multiple cameras, it's nice to be able to simply add the QR plate to each one for quick gear changes in the field.<br /><br />One word of caution! Spend the extra money and get at least the mid priced Manftotto gear. Some of the Manfrotto tripods I've seen in the &#34;big box&#34; stores don't seem to be quite the same quality.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>19878551</td><td>R20EJUP8QXYAXG</td><td>B00301UMEK</td><td>193414116</td><td>Synergy Digital Lithium-Ion Camcorder Battery (6900 mAh) Replacement for Sony NP-F970 Battery</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>One Star</td><td>I also got the Halcyon and after 3 months it stop charging!

As &#34;plug & play&#34; as it gets!  Very user friendly.  Basically just turned it on, inserted a thumb drive with pics and tried a couple buttons (without referencing user guide) and off it went!  Photos show well with good color.  For best results in color density, etc. I will  reformat them to the size noted in an earlier review.  I have not set up motion sensor etc. but am not worried.  Reviews of customer support are great but the user guide is straight forward, easy to follow and I anticipate no difficulties.  I love the 12&#34; screen for viewing across the room.<br /><br />This is our third photo frame and we have it run continuously changing out a variety of thumb drives/memory cards for different trips, family photos, etc.  Although it showed photos, the menu function worked poorly, was difficult to set up, color range was &#34;good&#34; and the in-frame adjustments were poor.  About the same price as this Nix, it was definitely mediocre but only one available - on line or retail - that was satisfactory.<br /><br />I have looked at reviews of virtually all of the digital frames and this is the only one to buy, in my opinion.  One of the frame companies have you load pics to on line site & sell that by saying you can load from phone or Facebook, etc. but they have complete rights to your photos without any compensation to you if they use them commercially.  Talk about invasion of privacy!<br /><br />Based on 7 years of experience with other photo frames, in my opinion this frame is top of the line in function and easy of use.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>33174315</td><td>R263ME7Q9R5HX1</td><td>B000928LM8</td><td>111001237</td><td>Tamrac N11 Backpack Camera Straps</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>good stuff</td><td>I really like it except the straps that are left on the camera after uncliping the pieces are probably a little short.

Words words words words words words words words words words.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Intellect's review<br /><br />&#34;Is that a GoPro?&#34;<br /><br />-Every camera waving function I've ever been to. Airsoft fields, corporate events, brony meetups, anime conventions, you name it.<br /><br />I'll fix some typos as I find them. Sorry if you find one before I do. Also this review is too long. AMZ keeps cutting it.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />I uploaded some great photos before but AMZ forgot about them and they disappeared. Sorry. Also one thing I noticed was Veho's marketing division did a really good job of hiding photos of the backside of a K2, no LCD screen.<br /><br />This review is intended for owners of the Veho MUVI HD10 (or Veho MUVI HD NPNG).<br /><br />It's also rather long so if you prefer the common Simpleton Amazonian Review please scroll back up and use that so you can return to your previous camera waving pursuits without need for detail.<br /><br />If you're a first time action camera buyer, this review probably won't help you at all especially with all the other choices you have (GoPro, Sony, Garmin, Polaroid, Contour). Not to mention Veho's slightly negative reputation for not honoring their warranties, though I don't think they have one. I've been using the Veho MUVI HD10 for about a year with no major problems and pretty darn satisfied so I'm fine but if you value piece of mind (or you're careless with your electronics) bear in mind you're probably on your own here. Point is, there are a lot of companies fighting over GoPro's piece of the cake which economically makes sense since we get some nifty innovation, but it's hard to compare side by side which is better and it's not just megapixel these days. Most DSLRs can produce photos better than most mobile phones but who wants to carry some expensive rock around all day? No one apparently because Nikon and Canon and losing a ton of money since everyone is on Instagram with their selfies and overly retro hipster filters.<br /><br />And if you're a GoPro owner with any of the more recent models, you're probably very satisfied with your current camera and need not to be here unless you're looking for more volume or better features like sound (more so compared with older models)<br /><br />About me: Slightly young, inspiring, and independent camera whipper since high school. I wanted to do more video but demand was in for photography so I've been waving about my DSLR when needed. Nothing is beyond me as I've done event photography big and small, from the glamorous white lined tables to down in the dirt: from friend's 10 person birthday parties and animal shelter openings to corporate dinners and golf courses at the Rosen' spanning at least 100 tables. From fundraisers at card shops and restaurants to business meetings/talks in downtown's most exclusive country club overlooking the city. Money has already been exchanged over what I do. And I've also been working the N.L.E. for a couple of years too, from musical performances at comic shops and conventions to theater style plays at conventions and at school. Oh, and I tried my hand some not so successful film festivals. I lost. Still good fun.<br /><br />Basically, I've done this photo, video, (and audio, a lot of people forget audio) before. I'll probably get a GoPro like everyone else if I have enough money/need for it unless Veho steps up their game. Or Contour. Lots to choose from. It's nice, but on the other hand you first time action camera buyers can get really confused. Everyone's got a GoPro and occasionally I'll be on an airsoft field and two guys on a team have a Contour. I'm that guy who has what looks like a GoPro but isn't.<br /><br />Short version: Veho MUVI K2 vs HD10. It's in upgrade in most respects. Video quality, versatility, WiFi, product dimensions, Heck, it sometimes feels like a different camera. This newer model is definitely more versatile though. There's some notes the HD10 that I miss though, but I welcome the obviously clearer looking video and increased versatility over the HD10. Especially since I know I had to work hard to pay for them. No company ever gave me a free camera.<br /><br />Also K1 buyers note the difference between the K1 and K2 is mostly bit rate. Whether you value the extra cash for the higher bit rate is up to you, and whether high bit rate is purely master race importance to you, see bottom. Whether having the money to go big and decide to go small is a personal crime, is up to you.<br /><br />NPNG buyers get more accessories. I will assume you are all smart enough to determine which points of this review are invalid.<br />-----------<br /><br />Compared to the MUVI HD...<br /><br />-Size<br /><br />As they proudly state on the site, the K2 is in fact smaller. Probably 3/4th the size of the old model. Probably achieved by getting that LCD screen out.<br /><br />-HDMI Out<br /><br />Only minor bug is if you somehow bought a mini HDMI cable to watch your HD10 on the big screen or connect as a webcam via capture card, that won't natively do you with the K2. Time to buy a new HDMI cable then.<br /><br />-Belt clip/alligator clip<br /><br />Not this time. Sorry private security people. The old base Veho MUVI HD package had one which was great for attaching to backpacks, belts, work uniforms, etc. That clip with the HD won't do you good with the K2. Veho is consulting their friends to release one so we have to wait. I miss my belt clip already. I bought a REC Mount 360 Rotary clip though so partially resolved. I say partially because..well, see the next section. As for the REC Mount, go look it up, I won't go into detail here.<br /><br />-Tripod screw + lack of compatibility with previous mounts<br /><br />Yes, tripod screw is still on the bottom which is still convenient compared to smooth bottoms of GoPros. Skeleton mount for the Veho MUVI what's that?<br /><br />Given: As I said, the old cup HD10 mounts you got with your HD10 package, forget about it.<br /><br />Downgrade: my K2 tripod screw is recessed deeper than my HD which means my normal Veho prong to tripod screw mount (the ones that came with the HD10 NPNG package for mounting the waterproof case to a helmet or chest mount), so I can not natively attach my K2 to my other Veho mounts. I don't know if this is QC or not. Basically the start of the tripod threading is too deep so it will never attach to my old HD era mounts: helmet/head mount, chest mount, etc.<br /><br />Four ways to circumvent K2 not attaching to your old HD10 era tripod mounts (namely the prong system to tripod conversion, aka waterproof adapter)<br /><br />1. Cheap tripod screw used for DSLR brackets. You know those 1/4-20 thumbscrews with male on top and a circular base plate with female on the bottom? If you stick on to the K2 and then screw it to the older adapters, you're good to go. I fixed my REC Mount clip that way once so I could attach my K2 to a backpack (since the old adapters won't work). Chances are you'll have to toss that in an EDC bag because some tripods threads are in fact too long for the K2, which means even if you screw the tripod head all the way into the K2, it'll spin around and be loose. I had that problem with the HD10 when doing a video shoot with one of Central Florida's finest balloon artists. I fixed with two cents though.<br /><br />2. Buy adapter with a longer tripod screw. I personally fired from the hip and dark bought a Rec-mounts Gp-cn-m conversion adapter. I can't recommend it now since the Japanese want you to pay +$22 for a small piece of plastic and that's really crazy, but when it arrive I was surprised to discover the screw was long enough to natively attach the K2 without a tripod screw from 1. Now I can easily attach my K2 to my belt clip, which means easy K2 to backpack video. Other Asia sellers might work though. I can't promise.<br /><br />3. Replace the screw from the current HD10 era adapter with a longer one. This one takes engineering and scavenging so I can't recommend it as I can't do it myself. Theoretically it makes sense though. The winning prize is you can save a good amount of money. If you're lazy like me, try the above.<br /><br />4. Use the waterproof case. I use this cameras on land so having to attach the waterproof in a nonviolent area and deal with the bad sound is a white person problem.<br /><br />Remember: Old MUVI HD mounts, remember those cups with the screw you may or may not have gotten? Those won't do you good any more. The prong to tripod screw ones for the waterproof case in the NPNG package will though as well as your old mounting bases (the adhesives, suction cups, car screw kits, RAM Mounts as I use one, etc)<br /><br />-Lens<br /><br />Fancy math and technical f/2.7 aside, the lens size looks roughly the same. Sharpness? Does it really matter? How does one sharp a piece of glass anyway?<br /><br />My K2 came with a removable flange lens hood to protect the lens when not in the waterproof case. That was really neat. The hood doesn't fit in the case of course, so you'll have to take it out.<br /><br />Physics: Also improved was the distance between the lens and the tripod socket since the K2 is pretty much on top of the socket where as the HD is a couple of inches away from the bottom (like a GoPro). This means slightly less shaking on most mounting scenarios. Example, if the point of pivot is below the camera, you will realize less shaking in the K2 than the HD. Horizontal mounting yield most benefits includes surf boards, helmet/head straps, chest straps, most bicycles, dashboard cameras, most car roll cages, etc. It's hard to explain, but imagine you have a piece of string and you spin it clockwise over your head like a lasso. Which part of the string will move the most? The one closer to your hand or furthest?<br /><br />-Battery<br /><br />Oh sweet Celestia, yes. The K2 has a removable Li-ion battery with a sticker naming it the Veho DS-S50 at 3.7V 1500 mAh 5.5Wh. I don't know (or really care all that much) what those numbers mean alone, but in battery life I'll get to that soon, but know the fact the battery is removable means you don't have to mid combat recharge.<br /><br />HD10 out of battery? Wall charger or a USB power bank (Veho would like to remind you to buy the Pebble brand pebble) and wait 3 hours because the HD10's battery is locked away well inside.<br /><br />K2 out of battery? If you bought a second battery, simply replace it.<br /><br />Also important is MUVI HD function is tied to the mini USB port. So if that were to damage or break on the MUVI HD, you can't recharge your camera again, which means it broke. Well bummer. The good news is if Veho starts selling standalone battery chargers or extended battery packs(they don't sell one yet, but hopefully will) and you were to completely wreck the mini USB port (or it just breaks), you're still in the game. For the above, we wait to see if Veho were to contact their friends over in the Shenzhen, PRC, if you know what I mean. Heh heh heh.<br /><br />-Battery life<br /><br />Downgrade (while bearing in mind the power consumption required to bring the nicer looking video). I battery dumped the K2 twice and it appears to promise a total 1 button continuous record run time of 2 hours 30 minutes, where as the new HD10 runs a consistent 3 hours. My HD10 after +1 year of daily use only gets 2.5 hours now. Maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less. Wi-Fi, LCD, and other functions off of course (as well any other interaction which uses power), 720p60. (I'll get to those).<br /><br />I ran 1 battery dump with the Wi-Fi on and got a similar time: longest constant video 2:30 hours. It's statistically incorrect to assume the Wi-Fi doesn't use more power at this time though.<br /><br />GoPros (the main competitor and leader) get similar time so no compliant here. Just don't be thatsimpleton AMZ reviewer who 1 starred the GoPro entirely in a half sentence review &#34;battery lif was too short.&#34;<br /><br />Ways to resolve battery life if 2.5 hours really isn't enough for you:<br /><br />1. Buy post purchase batteries and exchange batteries when depleted<br /><br />2. Wait for friends in Shenzhen to talk about the attachable battery pack add on<br /><br />3. USB Power banks. All the trendy kids love their Ankler lip stick power banks for their size, but I like my power banks hungry so I got a PowerAdd recently. 10400 mAh means I can get 12 hours of video. TWELVE.<br /><br />My current Nvidia Gefore GT 630 lacks the memory cache and CUDA cores to render a 12 hour long video (720p60) within a week. The memory card, assuming 32 GB, at 720p60 will probably only get you ~4-6 hours of video. Times ~3 full memory cards.... ~96 GB. Then you have to upload that sucker. Most YouTube attention spans lose it around 5 minutes. Most pop music sounds boring after 3 minutes. Most television commercials that are 1 minute feel long. I saw a comment on a Vine FB page once complaining that 12 seconds was too long for a Vine. Sweet mother of Celestia where have we gone?<br /><br />Anyways.<br /><br />4. If recording in a car, stop whining like some cheapstake that the Veho MUVI VCC-A097 usb cable costs $15, and buy it, and you'll never be out of battery on the road (as it also works with the K2 as it did with the HD) which is important for road trips where you value having a dashboard video to show the state police. Cable, $15, not having to pay insurance + civil court room over an auto collision because you couldn't prove you were not at fault since your camera ran out, probably more than $15. Suck it up. Don't be a complainer.<br /><br />5. Turn off the extra features (WiFi, LCD screen if you bought it, etc)<br /><br />6. Stop recording during breaks.<br /><br />My K2 spends 90% of its time mounted upside down in my car fully connected to the cable so I don't get to reach the end of battery life that often. With my PowerAdd power bank as I said that came in yesterday, I'll keep it that way for in the field.<br /><br />-LCD Screen<br /><br />In my package (my package was not NPNG of course), no LCD screen accessory included. Veho MUVI HD buyers, sports people, security/law enforcement, and casuals raved on and on about the integrated LCD screen's ability to play back video right there on the spot (though as much space as it took and not to mention if you helmet mount it's kind of pointless not being able to see it), well now you'll have to buy one. The K2 has some minimalist screen on top that only tells you what mode you're in, battery, recording time left (an upgrade to the HD10), etc, but it won't tell you what you're looking at. Oh, and if you use the K2 waterproof case you got in the regular package? You need a new backdoor to fit the LCD screen since the waterproof case is completely flush fit for no accessories. As I said, it's both a down and upgrade as having the LCD screen is nice, but having the K2 smaller than the HD and having it `$40 cheaper (MSRP of the LCD if it were included) for those of us who don't need the detachable LCD screen is even nicer.<br /><br />Veho sells the LCD screen and waterproof case backdoor you need to make it fit, according to their site.<br /><br />Good news for most of you with modern phones. You don't need the LCD screen anymore because you now have...<br /><br />-WiFi<br /><br />Upgrade all the way. Wi-Fi is enabled by a switch directly below the record button. I have an iPhone and got the Veho K2 app that allows me to live preview the video (2-4 second delay), watch old video, change some of the settings, take video, take photo, etc. Why bother with an LCD screen if you can plant the K2 on your helmet and look through your phone? Both your phone and the K2 probably use more battery though, so note that.<br /><br />WiFi works by enabling the switch, installing the app (do they have it for Androids? I think so), tell your phone to join the network, then run the app. The app looks like some older HTML webpage so it's not the most pretty, but what do you want to pay someone to work on, the camera or making some app pretty?<br /><br />Of course, if you have some older Nokia still circulating overseas (as durability is more valued than fancy features on a fragile device), you'll have to miss out.<br /><br />Minor annoyance: In order to watch videos on a mobile phone (via WiFi), the K2 creates thumbnail videos (.THM), which is fine, but sometimes it forgets WiFi is off and makes them anything. They take up space on the memory card. Not a lot, but if you're on the edge for space, they do add up.<br /><br />-Button Function<br /><br />Good or bad?<br /><br />Depends on how you use it. I like it. You might not.<br /><br />The button order, I could do into detail but the manual is publicly available in PDF form.<br /><br />Just know this, with the Veho MUVI HD (and the GoPro) the record button is also used as the stop button, but with the K2 there is a button to record and a separate button you have to press to stop recording. Kind of like the old HD10 remote.<br /><br />It's complex but I personally like this system because there is no doubt. When I play airsoft where the camera is attached to my head entirely and we have breaks between rounds where I stop recording to save power, I can forget if I'm recording or not recording so if I press the button, am I now not recording or did I just start recording? It's a losing game. I'll either stop recording and miss out on a good moment or start wasting battery by recording generic break footage (and then eventually end up in a future point where I have to stop recording sooner). The lazy solution is to always record. Well....<br /><br />With the K2, if you spam press the record button, you will know you're always recording. If you spam press the stop button, you will always know you stopped record. Of course some of you probably are used to the one button to start and same button to stop, so you won't like it as much, but I welcome this complex system. It'll take some memory to get though.<br /><br />-Waterproof case<br /><br />Still keeping the water out. I don't get to run the waterproof cases in water that much but I test them every now and then. Do not clean your waterproof cases with any cloth as the box says. If cotton fabric gets on the seals it could compromise right open. Use a hair dryer or shake it.<br /><br />The direction of the latch is a little different. I'd explain it but, uh, I won't. Go look at the photos.<br /><br />There's threads on the back. The NPNG package's waterproof case had a huge clip for those that want to clip the waterproof on something. I've yet to find mine in my package. Well, I got the regular K2 so maybe not.<br /><br />Oh, and maybe the new case looks a bit cooler? The old HD case was mostly see through and looks like a water bottle where as the K2 has a front plate in black and I guess looks like a Stealth Jet. Maybe not. One thing is certain, with the black box being attached around your helmet hopefully nobody will mistake it for those pearly white GoPros.<br /><br />There's still the MUVI branding text on it, as with the unit itself. Guess the K2 wasn't really catering for the private security industry this time, though the HD works fine for that.<br /><br />There's a small removable screw/knob thing whatever on the right side of the waterproof case that's intended for some future optional mini USB lavier microphone for those who don't want to deal with waterproof sound, I'll get to that in a bit. The GoPro hobo solution is a skeleton case or to drill a bleeding hole into your $50 no-longer-waterproof case. The GoPro hi-tier solution is to buy some special case that supports waterproof and 3.5mm mics to an extent. Is there even a waterproof microphone? Maybe.<br /><br />Semi related note: I had the chance to dashboard camera a GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition once. Dashboard camera no waterproof case K2, it survived being in direct Florida grade sunlight for +2 hours. My friend's GoPro Hero 4 waterproof case auto turned off after about an hour or so. Basically, don't leave them in direct solution for an hour. It hurts.<br /><br />Hurts the camera or you?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />-Sound<br /><br />Yeah it's slightly better than the HD, which was a lot better than most GoPros back then. No telephone sounding audio here. It's still in mono as it always is and should be (except for a few stand out action cameras). But although it sounds clearer, you can hear a quiet beeping/hum from the camera that wasn't with the HD10. Oh well.<br /><br />Why does sound matter so much?<br /><br />Most of these cameras will spend their life in the waterproof case and if you ever heard a waterproof case camera, it doesn't sound fun, whether in 44.1 kHz or in 11 kHz. If sound is a buying factor for you action camera (which statistically is spent surfing, sky diving, high speed biking, racing, etc other sports that are hazardous to your expensive camera when not protected), you may be doing it wrong.<br /><br />As I said, there's an unrelased mini USB microphone that plugs to the side of the camera if you're so inclined, but you won't find out about it here for a while.<br /><br />True story: some Amazon pleb downvoted the MUVI HD10 because the sound in the waterproof case sucked and said to buy a GoPro (which apparently sounds better in the case). If you find that pleb on Amazon, stop what you're doing and run away before he/she tries talking to you.<br /><br />-Low light performance<br /><br />Better than the MUVI HD. Yes. I see it. Even my casual nonphotographer friend sees it. No more HD10 wild frame rate halving and high contrast light gradients on the road as I use mine as a dashboard camera.<br /><br />Every camera stinks in low light. Every. Veho, GoPro, Sony, Garmin, Polaroid, Nikon, Canon, Fujifilm, Olympus, Pentax, Kodak, iPhone, etc. You could modify your camera to receive infrared light similar to surveillance cameras for home/business use and then setup infrared emitters, but you'd only make us more jealous.<br /><br />Dashboard camera users: remember with the limited dynamic range these mechanical devices have, the act of trying to properly meter road with street lights and headlights shining directly at the camera makes it hard to achieve that oh so magical ability to read license plates at, say, 20 feet at night that the human eye can.<br /><br />Either way, anyone experienced with the ~15 FPS low light footage of the Veho MUVI HD will have a fabulous time seeing the low light footage of the K2. There's a video on YT somewhere of the HD10 vs K2 low light. I wonder who. Semi colon right parenthesis.<br /><br />-Included micro SD card<br /><br />Was it included? If it was, it's probably the same. Both not worth it. You're about to dump a hundred or so on a camera, surely you can get the card for it.<br /><br />Go buy a SanDisk Class 10 one for 32 GB and you could get around 4 hours of video (note 2.5 hours battery life). I say SanDisk because it seems to be the most universally accepted card for DSLRs. All your other off brands like Transcend, PNY, heck, even Sony or Kingston, maybe. If they work for you, great, but my reputation is at risk here so I'm not letting my camera stop during an event because I'm trying to be cheap.<br /><br />64 GB? My friend got me a SanDisk 64 GB card this week and I've been testing it. It seems to worth but I can't warrant an opinion yet, too early. I did a DC power test though with the K2 and successfully got 8.5 hours of video at 960P60.<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget to keep a micro SD to SD adapter in your car if you use it as a dashboard camera. If you get smashed on the interstate, most LEO laptops don't natively read microSD, but reading SD? More likely.<br /><br />-Video modes.<br /><br />Okay. Mixed. Downgrade? Upgrade? I don't know how I feel about this one. I call it token 1080P. The site says 1080P, the device says 1080P, the resulting MP4 file says 1080P, but it doesn't feel like 1080P. I tried 720P60 for a while but now I run it 960P. Why?<br /><br />At CES 2014 Engadget said VEHO said 34 Mbps which was fine, but on the website and on my unit its highest is 19 Mbps. What does this mean? I'm starting to believe with only 19 Mbps in a second to work with, the more larger and faster frames you put, the less data you have on each individual frame.<br /><br />Lazy math. 720/1080 = 66%. 19 / 66%? ~28. Almost 34 Mbps. You see this? I don't know what it means, but if we want consistent frame quality the Mbps should increase, especially if the FPS does.<br /><br />When I first got my K2 I ran a driving test (day time) with the 1080p30 from the K2 and the 1080P30 from the HD. Though my test wasn't scientific, I found despite the K2 having more FOV than the HD, there were signs on the HD I was unable to read on the K2 despite both cameras being close to each other. It would seem the 1080P on the K2 is either slightly worse or the FOV was too wide. Even FOV wide aside, I noticed more artifacts combined to the HD10. Does this mean fraud and we should run away? Hopefully not as it may require more testing, but I looked at the K2 for lower settings on the list, 720p60, and found it satisfactory for 720P. 720P120 however yields more less sharp video (by Mbps rule) than 60. After a month of using 720P60, I changed it to 960P60 because by plugging the HDMI cable into my tv screen I found that the photo mode resolution and the 960P resolution are very close, so I'm assuming it's maybe the native resolution.<br /><br />My opinion: I don't use the K2 for 1080P. 960P60 is great and heck, most of you can survive on 720P. Does lack of mind blowing 1080P mean it's automatically a bad camera? Read way below for philosophy.<br /><br />-Misc unorganized notes, also publicly available in the manual.<br /><br />Owners of the HD10/NPNG noted there was some 1/20th chance upon power up that sound wouldn't be recorded, which made it a turn off for some L.E.O.s. I circumvented this by listening for the beeping sound on the HD10. With the K2, no sound bug so far. Daily use since I bought it in December.<br /><br />Digital zoom, why? Still here with the K2 though as a menu for choosing a set of predetermined FOVs and through the app where it's fine adjustable like the HD10 was on 720P. Does it stay after a shut down? I don't know. Who cares.<br /><br />Audio only feature, if for some reason you elected to spent $200 again on a device that only captures audio as a backup (or you're doing covert wiretapping action), fine, yes, it's still here.<br /><br />Auto standby. Still here. Whether you need it or not, your call.<br /><br />Timestamps. What about them? Unless you're working private security, have an untraceable YouTube channel to place your dashboard video (where timestamps could incriminate your routes), or on vacation, you probably don't need them, but the K2 apparently has them. But they work. And look slightly more...timestampy than the HD10.<br /><br />Loop record still around. Dashboard camera users rejoice, no deleting files after every drive. Theoretically, with a proper power supply you could record a full duration of 32 GB, ~4 hours or so, in one press, or 64 GB, 8 hours. That reminds me<br /><br />Video files are still split up every x minutes. Maybe 10? I'm a smart guy who can work an N.L.E. and combine them so nonissue.<br /><br />Selectable spot focus for exposure also here. No idea what that is? Look it up. If you don't know what it is, chances are you don't need it. I know I don't.<br /><br />Remember the selectable green light self-timer on the front face of the HD10? The K2 has a similar light. It's this hilarious blue ring that surrounds the record button and is probably visible in a dashboard situation at night from yards away. A lot brighter than the old green light. Waterproof case hides it which is good for airsofting in low light. I was at a convention related meetup with the K2 doing video and some guys said it looked like the Chase bank logo. Nonetheless the K2 apparently has a way to turn it off, but I find it hilarious to keep on. If you walk around in public with the blue light on everyone will be asking about your &#34;GoPro.&#34;<br /><br />HD10 vox mode? No more in the K2. Now there's some G-Sensor thing that apparently starts the camera when it's shaken. I've yet to use it.<br /><br />180-Degree Image Flip on the K2 says it can automatically detect when the camera is upside and correct it, a plus for the dashboard camera upside down mounters. Nah. On my camera it's just a switch that flips all video. And then it forgets the setting every couple of hours. Useless for me, though I'm smart enough to flip it on my own so nonissue.<br /><br />-Final idealistic thoughts on 1080P, bit rate (and to effect, the GoPro Master Race)<br /><br />I read some of action camera online community shaming the MUVI (at least those who even heard of the MUVI) saying it's a bad camera because the video quality (at this price) doesn't appear to top the GoPro.<br /><br />Mar 6 edit: I had like really long half technical half philosophical post and a fun story involving a photographer friend who owned a studio for 10 years who could not tell the difference between the K2 footage and his GoPro Hero 4 footage that I had both took for a test drive, but AMZ doesn't like this really long review, so I will simply say short like this:<br /><br />This is no guaranteed correlation between production costs and YT views.<br /><br />If you think getting expensive cameras will automatically grant your views success, I recommend you look up &#34;Vines.&#34; Chances are these little ~7 second videos filmed on iPhones have brought more views than most of us with our cute little &#34;GoPro test video&#34; (type that in YT). If views are what you seek, stop being a boring iPhone owner.<br /><br />But either way, it's a camera. You worked hard to pay for it, you deserve it, so go outside and find something, then look for someone who needs video help and be of use. No amount of camera doesn't deserve to collect dust and only be used a handful of times.<br /><br />Ask me your questions and I answer them the best I can.<br /><br />Anthonyve it for Androids? I think so), tell your phone to join the network, then run the app. The app looks like some older HTML webpage so it's not the most pretty, but what do you want to pay someone to work on, the camera or making some app pretty?<br /><br />Of course, if you have some older Nokia still circulating overseas (as durability is more valued than fancy features on a fragile device), you'll have to miss out.<br /><br />Minor annoyance: In order to watch videos on a mobile phone (via WiFi), the K2 creates thumbnail videos (.THM), which is fine, but sometimes it forgets WiFi is off and makes them anything. They take up space on the memory card. Not a lot, but if you're on the edge for space, they do add up.<br /><br />-Button Function<br /><br />Good or bad?<br /><br />Depends on how you use it. I like it. You might not.<br /><br />The button order, I could do into detail but the manual is publicly available in PDF form.<br /><br />Just know this, with the Veho MUVI HD (and the GoPro) the record button is also used as the stop button, but with the K2 there is a button to record and a separate button you have to press to stop recording. Kind of like the old HD10 remote.<br /><br />It's complex but I personally like this system because there is no doubt. When I play airsoft where the camera is attached to my head entirely and we have breaks between rounds where I stop recording to save power, I can forget if I'm recording or not recording so if I press the button, am I now not recording or did I just start recording? It's a losing game. I'll either stop recording and miss out on a good moment or start wasting battery by recording generic break footage (and then eventually end up in a future point where I have to stop recording sooner). The lazy solution is to always record. Well....<br /><br />With the K2, if you spam press the record button, you will know you're always recording. If you spam press the stop button, you will always know you stopped record. Of course some of you probably are used to the one button to start and same button to stop, so you won't like it as much, but I welcome this complex system. It'll take some memory to get though.<br /><br />-Waterproof case<br /><br />Still keeping the water out. I don't get to run the waterproof cases in water that much but I test them every now and then. Do not clean your waterproof cases with any cloth as the box says. If cotton fabric gets on the seals it could compromise right open. Use a hair dryer or shake it.<br /><br />The direction of the latch is a little different. I'd explain it but, uh, I won't. Go look at the photos.<br /><br />There's threads on the back. The NPNG package's waterproof case had a huge clip for those that want to clip the waterproof on something. I've yet to find mine in my package. Well, I got the regular K2 so maybe not.<br /><br />Oh, and maybe the new case looks a bit cooler? The old HD case was mostly see through and looks like a water bottle where as the K2 has a front plate in black and I guess looks like a Stealth Jet. Maybe not. One thing is certain, with the black box being attached around your helmet hopefully nobody will mistake it for those pearly white GoPros.<br /><br />There's still the MUVI branding text on it, as with the unit itself. Guess the K2 wasn't really catering for the private security industry this time, though the HD works fine for that.<br /><br />There's a small removable screw/knob thing whatever on the right side of the waterproof case that's intended for some future optional mini USB lavier microphone for those who don't want to deal with waterproof sound, I'll get to that in a bit. The GoPro hobo solution is a skeleton case or to drill a bleeding hole into your $50 no-longer-waterproof case. The GoPro hi-tier solution is to buy some special case that supports waterproof and 3.5mm mics to an extent. Is there even a waterproof microphone? Maybe.<br /><br />Semi related note: I had the chance to dashboard camera a GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition once. Dashboard camera no waterproof case K2, it survived being in direct Florida grade sunlight for +2 hours. My friend's GoPro Hero 4 waterproof case auto turned off after about an hour or so. Basically, don't leave them in direct solution for an hour. It hurts.<br /><br />Hurts the camera or you?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />-Sound<br /><br />Yeah it's slightly better than the HD, which was a lot better than most GoPros back then. No telephone sounding audio here. It's still in mono as it always is and should be (except for a few stand out action cameras). But although it sounds clearer, you can hear a quiet beeping/hum from the camera that wasn't with the HD10. Oh well.<br /><br />Why does sound matter so much?<br /><br />Most of these cameras will spend their life in the waterproof case and if you ever heard a waterproof case camera, it doesn't sound fun, whether in 44.1 kHz or in 11 kHz. If sound is a buying factor for you action camera (which statistically is spent surfing, sky diving, high speed biking, racing, etc other sports that are hazardous to your expensive camera when not protected), you may be doing it wrong.<br /><br />As I said, there's an unrelased mini USB microphone that plugs to the side of the camera if you're so inclined, but you won't find out about it here for a while.<br /><br />True story: some Amazon pleb downvoted the MUVI HD10 because the sound in the waterproof case sucked and said to buy a GoPro (which apparently sounds better in the case). If you find that pleb on Amazon, stop what you're doing and run away before he/she tries talking to you.<br /><br />-Low light performance<br /><br />Better than the MUVI HD. Yes. I see it. Even my casual nonphotographer friend sees it. No more HD10 wild frame rate halving and high contrast light gradients on the road as I use mine as a dashboard camera.<br /><br />Every camera stinks in low light. Every. Veho, GoPro, Sony, Garmin, Polaroid, Nikon, Canon, Fujifilm,Olympus, Pentax, Kodak, iPhone, etc. You could modify your camera to receive infrared light similar to surveillance cameras for home/business use and then setup infrared emitters, but you'd only make us more jealous.<br /><br />Dashboard camera users: remember with the limited dynamic range these mechanical devices have, the act of trying to properly meter road with street lights and headlights shining directly at the camera makes it hard to achieve that oh so magical ability to read license plates at, say, 20 feet at night that the human eye can.<br /><br />Either way, anyone experienced with the ~15 FPS low light footage of the Veho MUVI HD will have a fabulous time seeing the low light footage of the K2. There's a video on YT somewhere of the HD10 vs K2 low light. I wonder who. Semi colon right parenthesis.<br /><br />-Included micro SD card<br /><br />Was it included? If it was, it's probably the same. Both not worth it. You're about to dump a hundred or so on a camera, surely you can get the card for it.<br /><br />Go buy a SanDisk Class 10 one for 32 GB and you could get around 4 hours of video (note 2.5 hours battery life). I say SanDisk because it seems to be the most universally accepted card for DSLRs. All your other off brands like Transcend, PNY, heck, even Sony or Kingston, maybe. If they work for you, great, but my reputation is at risk here so I'm not letting my camera stop during an event because I'm trying to be cheap.<br /><br />64 GB? My friend got me a SanDisk 64 GB card this week and I've been testing it. It seems to worth but I can't warrant an opinion yet, too early. I did a DC power test though with the K2 and successfully got 8.5 hours of video at 960P60.<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget to keep a micro SD to SD adapter in your car if you use it as a dashboard camera. If you get smashed on the interstate, most LEO laptops don't natively read microSD, but reading SD? More likely.<br /><br />-Video modes.<br /><br />Okay. Mixed. Downgrade? Upgrade? I don't know how I feel about this one. I call it token 1080P. The site says 1080P, the device says 1080P, the resulting MP4 file says 1080P, but it doesn't feel like 1080P. I tried 720P60 for a while but now I run it 960P. Why?<br /><br />At CES 2014 Engadget said VEHO said 34 Mbps which was fine, but on the website and on my unit its highest is 19 Mbps. What does this mean? I'm starting to believe with only 19 Mbps in a second to work with, the more larger and faster frames you put, the less data you have on each individual frame.<br /><br />Lazy math. 720/1080 = 66%. 19 / 66%? ~28. Almost 34 Mbps. You see this? I don't know what it means, but if we want consistent frame quality the Mbps should increase, especially if the FPS does.<br /><br />When I first got my K2 I ran a driving test (day time) with the 1080p30 from the K2 and the 1080P30 from the HD. Though my test wasn't scientific, I found despite the K2 having more FOV than the HD, there were signs on the HD I was unable to read on the K2 despite both cameras being close to each other. It would seem the 1080P on the K2 is either slightly worse or the FOV was too wide. Even FOV wide aside, I noticed more artifacts combined to the HD10. Does this mean fraud and we should run away? Hopefully not as it may require more testing, but I looked at the K2 for lower settings on the list, 720p60, and found it satisfactory for 720P. 720P120 however yields more less sharp video (by Mbps rule) than 60. After a month of using 720P60, I changed it to 960P60 because by plugging the HDMI cable into my tv screen I found that the photo mode resolution and the 960P resolution are very close, so I'm assuming it's maybe the native resolution.<br /><br />My opinion: I don't use the K2 for 1080P. 960P60 is great and heck, most of you can survive on 720P. Does lack of mind blowing 1080P mean it's automatically a bad camera? Read way below for philosophy.<br /><br />-Misc unorganized notes, also publicly available in the manual.<br /><br />Owners of the HD10/NPNG noted there was some 1/20th chance upon power up that sound wouldn't be recorded, which made it a turn off for some L.E.O.s. I circumvented this by listening for the beeping sound on the HD10. With the K2, no sound bug so far. Daily use since I bought it in December.<br /><br />Digital zoom, why? Still here with the K2 though as a menu for choosing a set of predetermined FOVs and through the app where it's fine adjustable like the HD10 was on 720P. Does it stay after a shut down? I don't know. Who cares.<br /><br />Audio only feature, if for some reason you elected to spent $200 again on a device that only captures audio as a backup (or you're doing covert wiretapping action), fine, yes, it's still here.<br /><br />Auto standby. Still here. Whether you need it or not, your call.<br /><br />Timestamps. What about them? Unless you're working private security, have an untraceable YouTube channel to place your dashboard video (where timestamps could incriminate your routes), or on vacation, you probably don't need them, but the K2 apparently has them. But they work. And look slightly more...timestampy than the HD10.<br /><br />Loop record still around. Dashboard camera users rejoice, no deleting files after every drive. Theoretically, with a proper power supply you could record a full duration of 32 GB, ~4 hours or so, in one press, or 64 GB, 8 hours. That reminds me<br /><br />Video files are still split up every x minutes. Maybe 10? I'm a smart guy who can work an N.L.E. and combine them so nonissue.<br /><br />Selectable spot focus for exposure also here. No idea what that is? Look it up. If you don't know what it is, chances are you don't need it. I know I don't.<br /><br />Remember the selectable green light self-timer on the front face of the HD10? The K2 has a similar light. It's this hilarious blue ring that surrounds the record button and is probably visible in a dashboard situation at night from yards away. A lot brighter than the old green light. Waterproof case hides it which is good for airsofting in low light. I was at a convention related meetup with the K2 doing video and some guys said it looked like the Chase bank logo. Nonetheless the K2 apparently has a way to turn it off, but I find it hilarious to keep on. If you walk around in public with the blue light on everyone will be asking about your &#34;GoPro.&#34;<br /><br />HD10 vox mode? No more in the K2. Now there's some G-Sensor thing that apparently starts the camera when it's shaken. I've yet to use it.<br /><br />180-Degree Image Flip on the K2 says it can automatically detect when the camera is upside and correct it, a plus for the dashboard camera upside down mounters. Nah. On my camera it's just a switch that flips all video. And then it forgets the setting every couple of hours.

I'll spin it another way, you could always hit big views, subscribers, and money with the top guys in GoPro, but wouldn't it make a better book and radio interview if you went the underdog way?    All bickering aside, the most important part of buying a camera, go out, use it, record something neat today and then help someone without a camera record something tomorrow. You worked hard, you earned it, you deserve it, and it's now your duty to serve those who can't.    All questions/comment/discussion/\\\\\"I disagree with you and here's why\\\\\"/ most welcome.

Be prepared though because it does add some weight to your camera. I have a Canon 6D with battery grip and Canon 430 ex II and the camera fits in it. In landscape I had to set the flash slightly of center but it causes no ill effects in my trial and error so for.  But lets just say having my flash above the lens for Portraits is great. No strange shadows from the side anymore.  Also the ettl cord works good. It is a very tight fit in the connection for the flash to the cord but i know that it will not come lose. This is the reason for 4 stars, It may wear in over time but they may also concern me in the future.    But right now the change in the pictures is truly great.

The MP2s for example is switchable between 3.0 and 3.6V for those little LiFePO4 batteries.  The MC0 doesn't do that but is switchable between 250 and 500 mAh.  This charger is different from those two in that it will charge both NiMH and Li Ion batteries. This is my second one, one for the home and one for my car.

I got this pack in a bundle with a Canon T5, and it fits great with two lenses and plenty more.<br /><br />I've pushed and pulled on it, and the quality of the one I got seems great.  Love the flexibility of the dividers on the inside.  If it's not evident from the picture, you can configure it to have separate compartments for pretty much any fragile bits you might be taking with you.<br /><br />Also, and this is VERY important for someone like me, the orange looks good.  My camera is not a source of income, it's a hobby, a fun toy basically, and I want accesories that look good.  This fits the bill, making me look and feel more professional than I am, without feeling like I'm being too full of myself.

I had to remove it and place it several times. I actually had two of these and toasted one in the process.<br />2) It was not a perfect fit to my a5100. The corners are cut to a different radius.<br />3) It doesn't appear to be adhered very strongly. If I hit the edges with my finger nail, it pops up easily, which can let in dust and leave air bubbles. Given the previous point about the corners, I worry that the corners are actually going to catch on things and pop up all the time.<br />4) The surface isn't very clear. It appears to me to be quite dull and covers/reduces the beautiful brilliance of the a5100 screen itself. Perhaps some might feel this is a 'feature' of the 'anti-glare' but the description should make it clear that it's going to dull the screen.<br /><br />My recommendation to the manufacturer: Pull this product from the mark and replace it with one without all of these defects.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>29144448</td><td>R1Z8HK2D8VYFO8</td><td>B00HMZG3YS</td><td>567289788</td><td>CamKix Case with Fully Customizable Interior for GoPro Hero 4/3+/3/2/1 and Accessories – Tailor the Case to Your Unique Needs - Ideal for Travel or Home Storage – CamKix&reg; Microfiber Cleaning Cloth Included</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>I'm glad I only paid $24</td><td>Not what I expected but it will do for now.

It's so small it easily can fit in your purse. I take it with me everywhere. I would highly recommend this camera to everyone whether you're a pro. who needs a smaller camera (instead of a huge DSLR) to take with you so you can capture those nature shots without lugging around a huge DSLR or an amateur who just takes pics for fun.

We live 500 miles away and I was concerned about being able to see regular updates of the baby, and the Frame definitely helps to allay those concerns.<br /><br />The frame was very easy to pair to the family account. A second frame lives with the other grandma. We also set up Playlists that are connected to each person's mobile phone so that they can easily send images to Nixplay. I emailed a bunch of images that I had taken at Christmas time to my own playlist on the Frame, though I had to downsize them to fit within the 8MB size limit. It was so cool to see them automatically appear shortly thereafter on the Frame.<br /><br />Each day when I turn on the Frame I look forward to the newest image of our darling grandchild.<br /><br />I am an avid photographer with over 11,000 images on flickr and was delighted to find that I could connect to the flickr album of baby images and add them to a Playlist. The Frame now cycles through all of my images, and ones from mom and dad and the other grandma. I did not have to downsize any of the images and e-mail them to the Frame. The only slight flaw with the process is that portrait oriented images (which display correctly on flickr) do not automatically rotate - they remain sideways, though you can manually rotate them using the nixplay remote control device.<br /><br />I would deduct a half of a star in my rating due to the awkward buttons on the back of the unit. In order to access the power button, menu or commands, you have to press one of 3 round buttons on the back of the unit. It would probably have helped if they were raised slightly or of different shapes. Nevertheless, the remote control is handy and allows you to access the most used commands.<br /><br />The Frame must always be connected to your wifi, and is not battery operated so must be placed near an electrical outlet and plugged in. A motion sensor located on the front shuts down the display after 30 minutes if there is no movement in the room.<br /><br />The website is easy to navigate, but for the most technologically challenged (such as an elderly grandparent or great-grandparent), it's best for someone else to set up the Frame and hand it over ready to go...<br /><br />The Frame has a nice feature set, and allows us to see a constantly updated set of images of our darling grand-daughter without having to e-mail or print anything!in.

This should be done outside.  Indoor accuracy was spotty once it synced (however this was expected since it relies on GPS technology).<br /><br />Second, it mounted to my Nikon above the built-in flash.  This prevented it from popping up.  Although I rarely needed a flash, an alternate mount would have been helpful.  I tied it to the strap to let it dangle.  I don't know if this is ideal, but it was my solution.<br /><br />Lastly, it only lasted 6 months for me.

The small and medium sizes are perfect for any of my prime lenses, and the large size fits all but my largest 300mm zoom. In use for my smaller zooms, they are elastic enough to be stretched beyond their measured size, and the cinch clasp is so strong it will hold the stretched pouch firmly in place without loosening, or compromising the padded protection. The nylon exterior material is slick enough that they slide effortlessly into and out of their slot in a camera bag.

I was overwhelmed with all the grips there were to choose from and read so many mixed reviews but I finally narrowed it down to this grip. I was concerned it may not match my camera but as it turns out, it matches perfectly! Sure I'm disappointed Nikon didn't make a grip, which would allow quick use of both shutters, but this is the next best option. To activate the vertical shutter, go to the shooting menu, choose release mode and choose quick-release remote. To go back to using the horizontal shutter, simply go back to single frame or continuous mode, whichever one you normally use. It does feel a little on the light side but I'm fine with it. There is no pop out infrared button or cord to deal with. It's a nice grip! ..........Update, I am disappointed to find out there are no battery trays so it does not take AA batteries as a backup.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>31900963</td><td>R14WFAXWY0L7X0</td><td>B00PC077H2</td><td>665789195</td><td>TMEZON 1.0 Mega Pixel 720P HD-IP Weatherproof Outdoor Network ONVIF POE IP Security Surveillance Camera with IR Cut Day Night Vision Bullet for NVR System PoE Power Over Ethernet</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Good value at the price but you get more by paying more for better cameras.</td><td>I took a chance on this because it is a tpsee camera board that uses UC2 software for video monitoring/recording and I already have 6 cameras that also use the same software.  It was nice to have an option on from whom to buy the cameras.  I bought this camera as a trial to see if I want to buy more from TMEZON and the jury is still out; I just haven't quite made up my mind.<br /><br />For security against external intruders, I recommend only using 720p in general locations where you're just looking more for just activity than for identification.  At all ingress and egress points, along with any other choke points that you know an intruder must pass, you should have 1080p at a minimum with 3MP or even 5MP preferable.  With higher resolution you have better hope of identifying an intruder to either recover your property or for prosecution.  That said, this, and most quality 720p IP cameras, will give a much better picture than almost all analog cameras.<br /><br />Since I had some general spaces I waned to watch besides just the doors and windows, I purchased one of these 720p cameras to try.  The video quality is very good, as has been my experience with any of the cameras based on the TopSee boards which use the TI 36x DaVinci series video processors.<br /><br />The IR/night vision is excellent, only limited by the number and intensity of the IR illuminators provided.  I'm using this camera up to about 20 feet with excellent results - which is no reflection on their promise of 20 meters IR coverage.  Of course my experience has been that effective IR range is about 1/3 of the promised &#34;detection&#34; range.  I just have not tried this camera beyond 20 feet.<br /><br />So, why only 4 stars instead of 5?  There are a few drawbacks with this camera.<br /><br />First, the lesser of the issues: there's no foam sealer provided in the mount.  I have bought a lot of outdoor cameras and all of them that had the cable in the mount (such that the mount covers the hole inthe wall so there's no exposed cable) have had a foam pad in the base to seal around the hole to protect the opening into the camera and the opening into your building.  This does not have it.<br /><br />Another issue, and the one that is really making me consider whether to buy more of these or not, is that this only does 20 frames per second at 720p.  This is the only 720p camera I know of with a 20 FPS limitation.  There are probably others but I just haven't seen that.  That may not be TMEZON's fault - it may be a limit on the board as shipped from tpsee.com - but it is a reflection on the camera, just the same.  This is the issue that has me hesitant to buy more of these.  I'm not saying I won't; I just have to consider what's more important: 30FPS or UC2 compatibility.<br /><br />Another problem with the camera is the lens.  It fisheyes, or curves, around the edges - again, I've never had an IP camera that did that.  It's not at all bad enough to make me not use the camera but it is noticeable.  Getting a better m12 megapixel lens wouldn't add more than a dollar or two to the cost of the camera.  Other TopSee cameras I have use a 3MP lens giving the same kind of fish-eye effect when using the 5MP mode.<br /><br />One option that tpsee.com offers on all of their board cameras that no one seems to put into a retail product is WIFI.  If TMEZON made a UC2 compatible cameras with WIFI, I'd be thrilled.  Also, I haven't seen any 1080p, 3MP, or 5MP cameras from TMEZON.  I hope they start selling them on Amazon soon.<br /><br />Other than those few little issues, the camera is pretty good.  If they offered WIFI I would buy more for sure.  If they fixed the lens problem, the FPS problem, and the rubber mount problem I would buy more for sure.  As it is, I guess I'll do more searching before I decide.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52554070</td><td>R1QU9UDTIBRK7R</td><td>B007J7J120</td><td>237703446</td><td>Olympus Digital Camera TG-820 (Old Model)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great Camera</td><td>This is a great camera. Waterproof, shock resistant, easy to use, lots of options, large view screen, great photos, good battery life. I bought this to use while snorkeling in Hawaii. The first time I used a waterproof case over my Canon 1400is. It was difficult to use becuase it was difficult to see the screen. This does not suffer from the same problems. The screen is easy to see even underwater. The controls are large enough to use even with light dive gloves. The beauty is that this camera goes from the air to under water and back againi and just works. I gotta say, it's really scary to just put the camera into the water but, it is fully waterproof. The only thing you need to do after a day at the beach is to rinse the camera in tap water to get rid of the salt and then dry it off.<br /><br />Suggestions: 1. Get a spare battery and battery charger. You can charge the battery while it's in the camera but while you're charging you can't use the camera. 2. Get the floatation strap; you don't want your camera to slip off your wrist and into 30' of water, 3. Get a small case for the camera. It's waterproof and shock resistant but there's no point in pressing the point. I got a small hard case for the camera so it is free of dust and protected from being banged around when I'm traveling (plus, there's room for the spare battery)</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>17709844</td><td>R1IMX8IU0UC966</td><td>B003ZHV70M</td><td>557875712</td><td>Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD (Discontinued by Manufacturer)</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>My favorite toy!!!</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>16957455</td><td>R363YR6E4NUQ97</td><td>B00KH8QLFI</td><td>712743600</td><td>Ritz Gear Premium HD MC Super Slim Lens Filter Set (UV, CPL, ND9, Warming) With SCHOTT OPTICAL GLASS</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Great glass, but no cloth!</td><td>The filters included in this kit are the CPL, neutral density, UV, and warming.

I recently lost my only other cloth, and was hoping to solve both my filter problem and my cleaning cloth problem with the same purchase.

Of course with the canon straps they are not made to be easily removed and reattached - not rocket science but for quickly attaching and detaching it's a pain, especially if you are going back a forth a lot.  So I found these and can say that it works but what I don't like is that you'll have these pig tails hanging on your camera all the time.  Better than having the strap but not really the best setup.  So what I did is I put keychain wire circles, small ones about 1/2 inch in diameter and attached those to the camera where the straps normally are threaded, then I attached the swivel hooks to the straps and all is well; the nice thing about doing this is that you don't have those 3 inches pigtails hanging off the camera, a much cleaner / organized solution is the my jerry rig.  Of course you can just buy the rings and hooks at a hardware store but I wasn't able to find any in black, which I prefer, all I could find was silver.  Anyway, I know, I'm a bit anal about things but I think I have a good solution for me.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>14908082</td><td>R1FPDYHS9G9M0Q</td><td>B00KCX8E1C</td><td>6320907</td><td>GoPro Bodyboard Mount</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Easy to install, not much more to say.

I wasn't taking any photos because there was a fine hair or line of dust near the mirror that was showing up in every snap I took under brighter light conditions. I was extremely reluctant to clean the inside of the body, but knew I would have to either attempt it myself or have it professionally cleaned.  I priced cleaning the camera locally and realized I was looking at an $80 job minimum.  Scouting around on Amazon, I saw the Altura kit for my model digital SLR (a Nikon D80), and learned that there was also a handy cleaning tutorial on YouTube, courtesy the company. I took the plunge. Today, I cleaned my camera body and three lenses, including a fabulous older and neglected Sigma lens that was encased in dust, and they are all now good as new. I took some test shots at the sky and that hairline defect is gone. The lenses are as responsive as they were they day I got them, I even removed small dust particles and oil smears I didn't know were there, and the resulting images are crystal clear and sharp.  For nine dollars I have all my buddies back. So very happy. Thanks so much! No more dread and fear associated with handling lenses and mirrors.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>16321911</td><td>RP5JXWWBA7KVS</td><td>B0042X9L6A</td><td>35093186</td><td>Nikon SB-700 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Not as good as the SB 910 but for the price you can't beat it!</td><td>This is an extremely reliable very versatile flash!

Yes this one DOES work!<br /><br />Also one of the other reviewers commented on how the remote doesn't have an on/off switch, this is true however I'm just going to take the batteries out when I'm not using it, they take AAA which are included.</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>15342993</td><td>R1SC57FJV33KEC</td><td>B00GO4GKXM</td><td>126855808</td><td>GoPro Dual Battery Charger for Hero 3 and Hero 3+</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Perfect</td><td>2015-01-03</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>2862077</td><td>R2MQTMSJWNT7SN</td><td>B005005EEM</td><td>405823614</td><td>HDE Metal Hot Shoe 1/4\"-20 Thread Screw Post Converter Adapter for Camera to Tripod Flash Mount</td><td>Camera</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>awesome competitive price</td><td>High quality metal, awesome competitive price.

Requires more trial-and-error than a dedicated flash.  However, most dedicated flashes are large, bulky, and expensive and there are no compact dedicated flashes available for most compact cameras.<br />&#62; Using the &#34;slave mode&#34;, you can add an auxiliary flash to a compact camera which has a built-in flash, but does not have a hot shoe.<br />&#62; If your camera has a hot flash shoe, you can use the flash in manual mode, attached via the hot shoe, on the camera (with or without a built-in flash unit).<br />&#62; The flash works much better with alkaline batteries that it does with rechargeables. I suspect that voltage is the issue.***<br /><br />SIMPLE USE (e.g., with point-and-shoot cameras, or just in general)<br />&#62; As a generalization, the simple manual/slave flash unit can improve most flash photos taken with a &#34;point-and-shoot&#34; camera.  Not every situation, but often enough to be worthwhile trying.<br />&#62; If the built-in flash simply does not have the power (say for an indoor group photo), the extra light added by the Vivitar can usually improve the photo, even if you have no control of the aperture or ISO (as is the case with many simple point-and-shoot cameras).<br />&#62; Example:  Photos taken with an in-camera flash are usually flat.  But, if you hold a fill flash in your left hand high and to the left, you create modeling shadows which can greatly improve the photo.<br />&#62; In general, use as a fill flash is pretty much independent of whatever the camera is doing---you are just filling in shadows or brightening highlights, not really altering the main exposure---so it doesn't matter if the camera is a fully automatic point-and-shoot or not, as long as the in-camera flash fires to trigger the (fill) slave.<br /><br />GETTING BETTER PHOTOS<br />&#62; Unlike a dedicated flash unit, every flash of this manual/slave flash unit is full power.  The flash unit has no metering circuits (TTL or otherwise), and your camera will NOT adjust to the flash.  So, to get the best photos, you usually have to adjust your camera to the flash output.  Unfortunately, modern cameras resist such manual adjustment.  Even if you set the shutter speed and aperture manually, your camera will probably pump-up the ISO, defeating your efforts. So you also have to set the ISO manually.  (On some cameras you can’t actually set the ISO, but you can limit the range to a maximum ISO, which in effect is the same thing).<br />Details:<br />&#62; Your lens will probably be sharpest between f5.6 and f11.  The larger the number, the wider the depth-of-field.  Usually, you'll want a wide depth-of-field.  So, if possible, set your camera to manual or aperture-preferred, and the aperture at f8.<br />&#62; IMPORTANT: Set the ISO manually at 200, or a maximum ISO of 200.<br />&#62; Take a picture.  If the picture is too dark, you can increase the iso up to ~800.  If that isn't bright enough, then open your aperture to 5.6.  Alternatively, (in manual mode) you can set the shutter to a slower speed (say, down to 1/30 sec) to use more of the ambient light.<br />&#62; If ISO 200 at f8 (your aperture) results in a picture that is too bright, then reduce the ISO (if possible) and/or stop down the aperture to f11 or f16.  For portraits or closeup photography the easiest way to adjust the exposure is moving the flash unit closer or farther away from the subject.  The illumination is a logarithmic function of the distance, so a small difference (e.g., of 6&#34;) can make a big difference.<br />&#62; The formula for best flash photos (within reason) is maximum lighting with minimum (e.g.,f5.6--f16) aperture and minimum ISO (200 or less), and taken with a moderate telephoto lens (see below).<br />&#62; Let the flash fully recycle before taking another photo.  This flash recycles slowly, especially with used batteries.  Wait for the red ready light to come on and then wait at least another 5 seconds with fresh batteries, or at least 10 seconds with used batteries.<br />&#62; Assuming your camera has a built-in flash, often the best strategy for the best photos is to use the manual/slave flash as your main or key light, and the built-in flash to fill in any dark shadows.  That is usually easier said than done, and it may be hard to follow my explanation:  Even most point-and-shoot cameras have a brightness (“lighter/darker”) control.  If your are using the manual/slave flash as your key light (adjusting the exposure by ISO/aperture/distance)---then on some cameras, the “brightness” control may adjust the built-in flash exposure, which you can used to adjust the brightness of the fill light (in this case the built-in flash).<br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF THE FLASH<br />&#62; Very small (about 1&#34; x 2 3/8&#34; x 3 1/2&#34; overall, but looks smaller, and easily slips into a small space), very light (about 2oz w/o batteries) and compact.  Can easily be carried in a pocket, or in the accessory pouch of a camera bag.<br />&#62; In slave mode, you have a choice of 4 options, whether the unit syncs with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th flash of your in-camera flash.  These days most in-camera units flash 2 or more times for various reasons---but if you change your camera settings, that may change.  In most cases, most users will need to set the flash to &#34;2nd flash sync&#34; which is labeled &#34;S2&#34;.<br />&#62; You can use two or more such flash units if desired.  Indeed, you could have 3 or 4 scattered around a room on desk-top tripods.  For example [[ASIN:B00DESFDRU Vivitar VIVMPT100BLU 6-Inch Table Tripod (Blue)]], etc.<br /><br />A GREAT BRACKET ACCESSORY--------CHEAP<br />For $7 (reduced from $40) you can get a great 6&#34; extension, with a ball-head, and even a little base.  You can use the base as a table-top tripod to hold the flash.  Looks like it was made for the flash and bracket.  [[ASIN:B000IDCDZY VideoSecu 1/4&#34; x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO]]<br /><br />FLASH VS FOCAL LENGTH<br />&#62; Nominally, this (and most other) flash units will cover the angle of standard wide-angle lens (28mm lens in 35mm format; 14mm in 4/3rds format; etc.), albeit it might be a little skimpy at the corners.  So with the same ISO and aperture, you can illuminate more people with a wide angle lens (or a zoom set wide).  However the result will look like a flat flash picture.  For a large group or a small room, you may have no choice than to use a wide angle lens, but if you can step back (without sacrificing too much in aperture or ISO), you'll get a better photo:<br />&#62; A &#34;normal&#34; lens (50mm in 35mm format; 25mm in 4/3rds format; etc) etc. corresponds closest to the view of the human eye, and therefore the brain translates 3D information from such a photo.  If illuminated by flash, a photo taken with a &#34;normal&#34; lens will have greater &#34;depth-of-illumination&#34; than the same photo taken with a wide angle lens, so the photo will have greater depth and look less like a flash picture.  Indeed, most pros have a (non-zoom) normal lens to take pictures of groups or children, etc.<br />&#62; A moderate telephoto (75-135mm in 35mm format; 40-70mm in 4/3rds format; etc) is best for portraits, babies, etc., and is pretty much essential for flash-illuminated portraits to be evenly illuminated.  That is, the depth-of-illumination will be even greater than with a normal lens.  Noses will appear smaller, and in general the photos will be more flattering.<br /><br />EVALUATION<br />&#62; At this price, this is obviously not a fancy, powerful, instant-recycling studio flash.  However, it is well built and works well, and does a good job of increasing the flash range of cameras withinadequate built-in flashes.<br /><br />*** If you use rechargeable batteries, the slave flash will become inconsistent after about 10-20 flashes---I think that's because the voltage drops too low.  Two fully charged rechargeables would be 1.2v + 1.2v = 2.4v, but the voltage might drop below 2v after a little use.  Two alkaline batteries start out at 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 volts, and would not drop below 2.4v unless the batteries were virtually dead.  Apparently the flash needs 2.3-2.4v to operate properly.  So, use alkaline batteries.<br /><br />&#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.hand, up and as far back as you can.  USING AS A FILL FLASH &#62; When you are using the slave flash only for fill, e.g., aimed at the ceiling, a reflector, a diffuser, or even backwards at the wall behind you, such that your in-camera flash (or other dedicated flash) is your main light source, then you can use the camera in auto-exposure mode, albeit I still recommend setting the aperture and ISO manually--the camera will then adjust the power output of your in-camera or dedicated flash.  The exposure computer in your camera is stingy with power---usually, it won't set your flash to maximum power unless you force it to.  The formula for best flash photos (within reason) is maximum lighting with minimum (e.g.,f5.6--f16) aperture and minimum ISO (200 or less), and taken with a moderate telephoto lens (see below).

If illuminated by flash, a photo taken with a &#34;normal&#34; lens will have greater &#34;depth-of-illumination&#34; (e.g. the ears will be nearly as brightly lit as the nose) than the same photo taken with a wide angle lens, so the photo will have greater depth and look less like a flash picture.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!","2015-08-31",5],["US",34584405,"RK6ZADB3W80HN","B001NY1UJM",14533641,"CowboyStudio 220 Watt Photography Studio Monolight Flash Lighting Kit - 2 Studio Flash/Strobe","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Love it.","2015-08-31",5],["US",16186864,"R2JF6AADBJXWPS","B002VPE1WK",839407277,"AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR/DSLR Cameras and Accessories - Black","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Great Case!","This case was a nice upgrade from my old bag.

I will note right away, if you do not own an iPhone are android phone this camera will likely not work for you. The setup is done through the app and without a phone that supports the app you will not be able to set the camera up.<br /><br />I found the camera setup to be relativity easy. You plug the camera in and then open up the app on your phone. From there you connect to the camera and setup the wifi password so that it can connect to your home network. One downside I did notice is that there is not a native app for the iPad. Because of this I ended up downloading the iPhone version of the app to my iPad and set it up that way. It would be nice if Kodak would make the app universal so that it wasn't so ugly on the iPad. This was my only complaint with the setup process.<br /><br />Using the camera for daily use is a breeze. The video quality is excellent and the pan/tilt feature allows you to see an entire room easily. The app also works well and allows you to set up notifications to alert you if motion is detected. This ensures that you will not miss anything moving in the room that you have the camera setup in. The app also gives you the ability to speak through a speaker that is on the camera, so if you have a pet you could easily speak to them remotely.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this camera is an excellent option for anyone that is looking for a home security camera. The quality is excellent and while the app is not the greatest, it does do its job well enough.","2015-08-31",5],["US",221141,"R18P3RW2HBRI5L","B00L2GJBOW",795532479,"Spy Pen Video Camera Audio Recorder By U-Guard Security Prod","Camera",0,1,"N","Y","Five Stars","Grest product","2015-08-31",5],["US",50923817,"RDJN88ERJ3H04","B00HV4XHX0",629357110,"[2 PACK] Long Camera / Camcorder Neck Shoulder Straps Belt - Length Approximately 36\" + Cleaning Cloth in Retail Packaging (Multi-Color (Blue) + Black)","Camera",1,1,"N","Y","Fast and accurate; just as advertised.","Being a larger than average photographer, I was having a hard time finding a long enough strap so my camera would hang comfortably.

Eventually I resorted to a Chinese GSM system but if you have ever tried that out you will know the term ' user unfriendly' was specifically created to decribe those systems. In came Korner and what a pleasant experience!<br />A few remarks:<br />One piece door contacts and real pleasing on the eye!<br />Absolutely user friendly - even a child can install them.<br />Direct control via an App on your phone.<br />Long battery life<br />The whole system is plug and  play.<br />Korner will send you an email as well as a pop-up on your phone if intrusion is detected.<br />Korner can be used as a door chime if not armed - so you can still monitor movement through the house even when it is disarmed.<br />Allthough the tags are meant to be used with doors/windows, I've dropped one in portable safebox at home and it works perfectly well to register movement of the box.<br />Very nice feature is that you can actually set up a circle of friends to be notified of intrusions - one can create your own personal neighbourhood watch system.<br />Customer service is excellent - I had a few questions/issues and time and again I was assisted in a prompt and efficient manner.

This charger by Indie Camera Gear seems to charge just as fast as my Canon charger, and I love how compact it is so it doesn't take up extra outlets when plugged into the wall! It has a red light that comes on when charging and it turns green when it is fully-charged. This charger also has overcharging protection, meaning that you can leave it plugged in overnight and it won't fry your battery! Considering a replacement 70D Canon battery runs about $60, it is VERY nice to have that extra protection! I actually missed that there would be a car charging cable included when I ordered this, so I was thrilled to find that cable in the box! I take a crazy number of photographs every day and one thing I'm not so good about is remembering to stop and charge the battery! This is extra cable plugs directly into the charger and allows you to charge your battery while you are on the go! I love having a car charger for vacations as well because how often do you remember, or have time to charge your camera battery at the hotel?

The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!","2015-08-31",5],["US",11736306,"R1MIRDB9OBMM3I","B00007EDZG",479032842,"Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","works well","2015-08-31",5],["US",1609987,"R29LIXAK3E6M1F","B00Y1ZCQCK",498684526,"Accessories for Gopro Monopod Tripod & Float Bobber & Chest Belt Strap Suit for GoPro Hero 3+/3/2/1 SJ4000 Xiaomi Yi Camera","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","fast shipping will do more business","2015-08-31",5],["US",52977496,"R18SPO7W3DVN43","B00H3Q8QB4",826842790,"Foscam FI9821P Plug & Play 1.0 Megapixel 1280 x 720 Wireless/Wired Pan/tilt IP Camera with IR-Cut","Camera",0,2,"N","N","SUCCESS!","I had a hard time setting it up but Vincent from Technical support walked me through the setup and got it working.","2015-08-31",5],["US",25013619,"R3PHJP3QAPWLVA","B00O9S08Z6",85219147,"Neewer VK750 II Pro i-TTL Auto-Focus Flash for Nikon DSLR Camera Deluxe Kit with Accessories (10 Items)","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Just as advertised.

Lens","Camera",9,9,"N","N","Don't Over Look This Lens","This is the first lens I bought for my Lumix G1, the reason, having no experience with Lumix lenses, was that Panasonic claimed that this lens was developed by Leica for the M4/3 system.  I have owned this lens for many years now. Frankly, I have not been disappointed.  The lens is impressive as it yields sharp balanced images,  I was not really expecting much at the the time, but it has proven to be a good value.  Since then I have bought many other Lumix and Leica lenses for my G1 and GX7, but I still use this lens frequently.  Last week I decided to give away my entire Nikon system that I used in my profession, a tough decision letting go of and old friend, but I had not really picked it up since I bought this lens. This lens has dampened focusing, or so it seems, and is easy to focus accurately, it is certainly a faster focusing lens than my equivalent Nikkors.  It is light weight.  I carry it in a fishing vest, along with several other lenses. and it gets bounce and banged around when I scurry up and down slopes to get a good position and it has held up well.  In terms of image characteristics it performs similar to my Zeiss lenses on my Hasselblad.  I like to make oversized prints and this lens serves well.  Lumix makes so many good lenses it is hard to know which to buy, I don't regret this purchase.  As a user of may old lenses by Zeiss, Leica and Schneider I would put this lens in the same class. The selection of glass has always been highly subjective relative to one's photographic tastes, so look at some test images to get a feel for the lens.  I really like it.","2015-08-31",5],["US",35033403,"R23SFHD8IAN3UM","B009F8UE4K",168397395,"MaximalPower_29","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Great","But unfortunately I had to return the item because I received a new camera for my Birthday","2015-08-31",5],["US",49523782,"R2GC63EU3MBG0R","B0116Q3U4Y",387804619,"Xvim Security Camera System CCTV Surveillance System with 960H DVR 4pcs 900TVL Cameras Outdoor Metal Housing Weatherproof Hard Drive Not Included -100feet Night Vision -IR Cut build in -Quick Remote Access via smart phone","Camera",4,4,"N","N","(video test and demo) Works awesome, simple to setup compared to other systems","[[VIDEOID:902e8616169ea6ef371d58868ce0a0e]] ✏️ Quick thoughts to supplement my video demonstration.<br /><br />Everything you need is included except for a monitor (one that accepts either HDMI or VGA) and a hard drive (just a basic laptop hard drive, \\\\\"SATA\\\\\" like this one: [[ASIN:B00AAKF8KC Generic 320 GB 320GB 2.5 Inch Sata Laptop Internal Hard drive 5400 RPM For Laptop/Mac/PS3 (320 GB)]].<br /><br />I like this security system because:<br />- It's very easy to setup. Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included). Click around and right click to \\\\\"go back\\\\\" in the navigation.<br />- Very smooth, excellent quality footage.  Not like that choppy stuff you see on old CCTV security systems.<br />- Tons of long cables. 60 foot cables (8 of them!). Note: Due to the length of the cable, there's a slight 1 second delay from the event to when you see it on your monitor.<br />- Full metal, tough camera design.<br />- Awesome in low-light/darkness. Infrared lights work wonderfully to light up the room when it's dark. (of course the human eye can't see infrared, but it lights up enough for the camera to film everything)<br />- Incredibly good price here on Amazon. Just factor in a hard drive and a monitor.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this camera system.

Had to run all the cat6 wires to where I was going to set up my cameras since these are indoor camera wanted to make sure they did not get wet.  One thing that you must do before installing the camera is to program them to the NVR to make sure they work before you put them up. I suggest doing this first. The instructions are not to clear about doing this. I had to call Amcrest technical support for the NVR. It took a while to get through but they were very helpful and also assisted me setting up my phone app that I downloaded from the Play store. You have to download the right app for whatever phone you are using or it will not work. For the Samsung Galaxy phones I downloaded the  Amcrest view lite app. it work fine so far. Over all for the price these are pretty good cameras I like the option that the can pan and tilt to get a better view of the area. The have a built in speaker which I have not gotten to work with the NVR yet you can also use a Microphone with them still working on that. Write more at a later date when figured out how to make them work.","2015-08-31",5],["US",3937898,"R2S4WC2QGJ3YIC","B00P0V0W1Q",654129912,"niceEshop(TM) Vintage Universal Camera Single Shoulder Sling Belt Strap For SLR DSLR Camera,Black White","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Vert sturdy.

If you are using a GE or Interlogix panel with this model it should be very easy to add to your existing system. Be sure to download your wireless panel's user manual, as you these smoke alarms usually need to go onto a dedicated group/zone, and be setup as a specific sensor. If you are using a monitored Concord 4 system, be sure to add the sensor text as &#34;smoke or fire alarm,&#34; and perhaps a location (which I did not as I don't really care where the fire or smoke is, I just want to know my house is on fire) so that the monitoring company will know that it's a fire emergency and not a police emergency. If you don't name this sensor I believe it will only tell the monitoring company that Sensor #XX has been tripped. I would recommend getting more than one unit for your home, and installing these yourself as it's free. It's definitely simple enough to do by yourself, provided you follow the instructions closely.

The SmapPole is longer than my other handle by about 4-5&#34; but this brings the camera further away giving a little bit more distance giving you a wider shot. I do see one thing that many mention, is that it has no grip built in the carbon fiber handle. This is very minor being that they include a detachable wrist lanyard that has an adjustable lock to keep it from sliding off your wrist. For those of you who have a mini tripod, you can screw the end of this handle to extend the height.

It has legitimately never let me down in my one year (almost) of ownership and I'll probably order 2 or 3 more in the coming months as my other contour mounts age.

AMAZING!","[[VIDEOID:1bae3276c6d7decdb282ac4b8041e6dd]]I decided to get the GEEK PRO HD sports camera and camcorder. Here's what I think about it.<br /><br />* camera/camcorder<br />* on/off<br />* power/mode button<br />* charging status light<br />* microphone<br />* HDMI<br />* USB PORT<br />* micro SD SLOT<br />* speaker<br />* screen<br />* Wi-Fi button<br />* medium shock resistant case/ waterproof housing<br />* handlebar/pole mount<br />* 7 various mounts to attach two helmets in gear and so on<br />* two clips<br />* Velcro bandages<br />* battery<br />* adhesive strips<br />* secure tethers<br />* manual<br />* USB cable<br />* charger<br />* Lens cloth<br />* carrying case<br /><br />First, I must say, this complete set is less than half of the going $$$ rate of the most popular sports camcorder. This definitely has more attachments and accessories included. All of the stats are very similar as well. It is a complete package with lots of great useful pieces included.<br /><br />You can record video, capture a single photo, capture photo burst, shoot a series of photos of the set interval time, watch video and photo playback adjust camera settings and resolutions and much more. Its quick to pick up even for the not so tech savvy. I count myself in that group. It literally does it all. If you're into filming or shooting photos this is definitely for you. The video is extremely high HD quality.<br /><br />We have really enjoyed learning about this camcorder. We have been testing its abilities. I love that it's versatile. If you can dream it up I guarantee there's a mount out there for it. I'm working on filming my cooking for my blog currently. I'm a chef by trade. I find this camera easy to use and operate by myself. This camera is perfect for a one person operation. Since, I'm cooking, I really like that it's water resistant. Spills happen! It really is a professional quality HD camera. It's amazing to me that it fits in the palm of my hand. This is perfect for using solo you can mount it easily to most anything.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this for everyone. Once you get it you'll think of 1 million reasons to use it. The audience for this camera and equipment is endless. It would make a great gift for anyone. It's not just for sports enthusiast. New parents or grandparents,<br />College-bound students, entrepreneurs, anyone with a YouTube channel, teachers or most everyone would love to receive this as a gift. It definitely fits most budgets. It's the same quality for half the price of the most popular sports camcorder.<br /><br />I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. All of the opinions expressed here are solely my own.1 million reasons to use it. The audience for this camera and equipment is endless. It would make a great gift for anyone.

It came with a kit that has all the parts you need to utilize this camera the way you'd want. The camera seems fragile but it isn't. Good quality camera that has all the functions. It's so tiny too and has a screen. It has fish eye lens that can zoom 4x. The wifi is cool that you can transfer image to your phone or tablet. It's just an awesome little camera. It's durable though. I played catch with my son and he wore it and the football would smash into the camera and the camera even took a tumble and it still maintained as though nothing happened. The price is super amazing. I got it as a lighting deal and it was a steal of a deal in my opinion. Thanks<br /><br />Now the cons are that there's no instructions manual. I feel like there's a lot more that I should be able to do but can't do it yet. Then again it's fun discovering new things about a device, but a link to instructions would be nice. Also there's so many attachment kits and it's hard to know what is what. A YouTube link showing all the feature would be awesome to solve this. The app could also be better. It's a bit laggy and slow. Maybe that's my device though. The buttons are so hard to figure out sometimes. I have trouble playing back the clip and fast forwarding. Also for some reason it stops recording at certain times. Like it'll record for a minute and stop and start a new clip. Again I feel that all falls on the functionality and instructions would help this. There may be a instruction link that I don't know of. If I do find it I'll use it and come back here to revise this review.<br /><br />Overall I gave this item a 5 star rating and rightfully so. It's a fun device that can be used by anyone for a wide range of things and the best part is that it's very cost effective. Also the quality and functionality of this camera is top notch. My kids have already asked for one for Christmas and I may oblige.","2015-08-31",5],["US",41466286,"R19U7UEI5FHKAH","B00TKLFA6O",443308689,"OP/TECH USA Utility Sling Duo","Camera",0,1,"N","Y","Distribute the weight of a heavy SLR","This item is exactly what I have been looking for.

Just like the underwater filters, these land filters fit very snugly/securely and your saving $40 when you buy a Three Pack over buying three filters individually. Polar Pro appears to have listened to feedback about their included synthetic tether because all three of my tethers that came with my pack (my Land Three Pack appears to be the newest version due to the Polar Pro's new logo on the storage bags compared to the old logo that was on my Underwater Three Pack storage bags) had their ends singed to prevent unraveling. That's a big plus and it's nice to know Polar Pro is willing to make improvements.<br /><br />The first photo I attached was shot using the Marco lens, with the setting on &#34;Medium&#34; width (Polar Pro recommends this setting with this lens). The second and third photos were shot with the Polarizer lens and in 12MP &#34;Wide&#34; width setting. If you buy both the Land and Underwater Three Pack Lens Filters, you will end up with two Polarizer lens filters.

I have an a-mount with a fairly cheap dummy adapter that works perfectly with my camera. I am able to take amazing shots, even in low light, that I was never able to do with the kit lens. I actually dread using the kit lens now, and have considered just getting rid of it and getting a smaller focal length prime Rokinon to replace it, as this 85mm you have to stand a considerable distance away from the subject to get a full body shot. I primarily take pictures of people at conventions and it does pose a problem with an 85mm prime, but if you want amazing portraits without breaking the bank this is the lens for you. I was skeptical at first about using a manual lens, but after figuring out the aperture ring, focus zoom, and the focus peaking I feel as though I'm not losing any time by not having autofocus.

Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included). Click around and right click to \\\\\"go back\\\\\" in the navigation.<br />- Very smooth, excellent quality footage.  Not like that choppy stuff you see on old CCTV security systems.<br />- Tons of long cables. 60 foot cables (8 of them!). Note: Due to the length of the cable, there's a slight 1 second delay from the event to when you see it on your monitor.<br />- Full metal, tough camera design.<br />- Awesome in low-light/darkness. Infrared lights work wonderfully to light up the room when it's dark. (of course the human eye can't see infrared, but it lights up enough for the camera to film everything)<br />- Incredibly good price here on Amazon. Just factor in a hard drive and a monitor.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this camera system. An excellent bang for your buck, especially considering how many cameras they give you.<br /><br />I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration.

I really wanted to see how this compares to both the Olympus 45mm 1.8 and the expensive F1.2 from Panasonic so I set up some tests and was VERY impressed.<br /><br />This lens is slightly sharper in the center and quite a bit sharper in the corners compared to the Olympus at the same price while also including O.I.S.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, the camera itself is actually made by Tenvis - you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note -this camera may be available from a few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!may be available from a few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!","2015-08-31",5],["US",22358649,"RKWW5H4ZN4I83","B009FGS6LA",24993489,"VideoSecu 4 Pack Dome Dummy Fake Infrared IR CCTV Surveillance Security Cameras Imitation Simulated Blinking LED with Security Warning Stickers C4B","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","They look real!

The lens is sharp, focus is fast and accurate. The optical finder is FANTASTIC when working in situations where the LCD screen is difficult to see. I had several other point and shoots before which had screens that made shooting almost guesswork, as you so often could not see the screen, even with a flip out hood on it. With this, I hardly ever look at the screen, as the finder works so well, it zooms right along with the LCD image. The only time the finder is not good is for closeups inside a couple of feet or so, because it is not through the lens, but rather a &#34;tunnel&#34; finder, meaning that while it works with the lens, the viewing is through a finder tunnel. Thus, at the very close distances, there is parallax error. So, when shooting at close distances, I just go back to using the screen. This camera is also very small, easily goes into a jacket pocket, pants pocket, even some shirt pockets. It also will use AA batteries, instead of something which has to be charged. Of course, if you prefer, you can buy rechargeable AAs and a charger, but if you are caught out somewhere, you can use regular AAs. Lithium type are preferable on the AAs, but alkaline will work, also. If using alkaline AAs, especially with flash, battery life may be a bit short. This accepts SD cards, so no problem with storage on it. You can vary file size (MP), I prefer to keep it at 16MP, and I have 20&#34;x30&#34; prints on my wall which are pretty sharp at that level. Video on this is adequate, as is sound, for a point and shoot. On video and sound, though, keep in mind that this is a tiny point and shoot camera, and should not be compared with DSLRs which cost 5-10 times and much and are also bigger and heavier. For a still camera, I don't think you could do much better in a point and shoot!","2015-08-31",5],["US",1630286,"R2JLA0SR2TD0YD","B00DS2MXTS",845984365,"Fujifilm Mini 8 Instant Camera","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Love it!","2015-08-31",5],["US",43424970,"R2PSPRD77T0ZUK","B00O1F18IS",94636837,"Rec-mounts Conversion Adapter 【Gp-cn-kw】gopro to 1/4 Camera Screw (Tripod Fixing Screw) (Aluminum Model)hdr-as100v Hdr-as30v From Aluminum Gopro Mount","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Superb build quality","Material is very sturdy, with very tight connections.","2015-08-31",5],["US",23817538,"R3FLBBLHT9VDJQ","B00GBVFAMU",824072169,"SFBAY Pro Remote Shutter Release Connection Cable Compatible with RM-S1AM Replacement Commander for Sony Alpha DSLR A900 / A850 / A800 / A700/ A560 / A550 / A500 / A450 / A400 / A350 / A300 / A200 / A99 / A77 / A65 / A57 / A55 / A37 / A33","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Good product","I tried it with a37 and a65.

This mount is different than the gopro brand because it has an extra pivoting head. I was able to tighten all thumb screws to prevent any movement and was satisfied that it would move while filming. Although I do suggest for any brand mount outside a vehicle to use a leash or tether just in case it loses suction. I usually use an old shoe lace cut very short and tie it some where to stay secure and not flap around in the wind. If you are going to use it on any glass I also suggest a good cleaning of the glass to get the best grip.

I watched some of the videos and the image is very clear – I could definitely identify any person who would try to break in, even at night.  Also, they are very easy to use.

In addition, I now have access to Aperture, Shutter and ISO controls so I have total control of the image. Speaking of apperture controls, I can even now get a shallow depth of field as long as the subject is close... something that I could never do with my smart phone.<br /><br />Before I got this phone, my walk around camera was a Sony RX100MKII, that camera has not been used in months, most of my snap-shots are now being taken with the CM1 and when I want to get really creative or need top notch quality I use my A6000.<br /><br />As for the phone, I have no issues thus far. I just updated the handset to Lollipop and the phone is great. I am a T-Mobile user and it is great to get a break on my monthly service because I own the handset (of course for $1000, I better get a discounted service plan) and I like that Panasonic didn't give the phone a stupid skin or tons of bloatware that I would never use. This phone is very close to a pure Android experience with the exception of the camera app and the timelapse app, but these are great and where really needed given the features that this camera offers.<br /><br />I have added some pictures so you can see the results, I am a happy camper and will keep this as my phone for a long time... at least until Panasonic ore someone offers a better camera in their phone than this one.","2015-08-31",5],["US",20128946,"R293PXPV760GHA","B006YYS832",745889638,"Replacement CB-USB5 CB-USB6 CB-USB8 USB Cable Cord for Olympus C-55 Zoom, C-5500 Sport Zoom, C-7000, D-425, D-435, D-545, D-595, D-630, Evolt E-30, E-330, E-400, E-410, E-420, E-450, E-500, E-510, E-520, E-600, E-620, E-M5, Pen E-P1, E-P2, E-PL1, EPL1s, E-PL2, E-PL5, SP-310, SP-320, SP-350, SP-500UZ, SP-510UZ, SP-550UZ, SP-560UZ, SP-565UZ, SP-570UZ, SP-588UZ, SP-590UZ, SP-610UZ, SP-700, SP-800UZ,","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","exactly as described..","2015-08-31",5],["US",52028014,"R181L9DSHI8OJN","B00HQDBLDO",799915272,"Nikon Coolpix L330 Digital Camera (Black)","Camera",0,0,"N","Y","Five Stars","it takes great pictures - I am quite pleased with it.","2015-08-31",5],["US",43366504,"R153A4143PNAJU","B000BAX50G",347398788,"Lowepro SlingShot 100 All-Weather Digital Camera Backpack - Black","Camera",0,0,"N","N","This bag is well built and well padded.

There are many different apps to use with this camera, I like Final Cam but SJCam works as well. With the recommended 32Gb micro sd card the camera can record for over 5 hours. I have not tested to see if the battery lasts that long yet, but i haven't had to recharge it since the first charge. Video's are broken down into 3 minute segments to make data file sizes smaller, although this can be changed to 5 or 10 minutes as well. Pictures turn out well as well, many options for this, maximum quality is 14 Megapixels 4320x3240. I would recommend this to anyone, Gopro's price at ~$400 is not worth it in my opinion.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>34584405</td><td>RK6ZADB3W80HN</td><td>B001NY1UJM</td><td>14533641</td><td>CowboyStudio 220 Watt Photography Studio Monolight Flash Lighting Kit - 2 Studio Flash/Strobe</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Love it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>16186864</td><td>R2JF6AADBJXWPS</td><td>B002VPE1WK</td><td>839407277</td><td>AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR/DSLR Cameras and Accessories - Black</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great Case!</td><td>This case was a nice upgrade from my old bag.

I will note right away, if you do not own an iPhone are android phone this camera will likely not work for you. The setup is done through the app and without a phone that supports the app you will not be able to set the camera up.<br /><br />I found the camera setup to be relativity easy. You plug the camera in and then open up the app on your phone. From there you connect to the camera and setup the wifi password so that it can connect to your home network. One downside I did notice is that there is not a native app for the iPad. Because of this I ended up downloading the iPhone version of the app to my iPad and set it up that way. It would be nice if Kodak would make the app universal so that it wasn't so ugly on the iPad. This was my only complaint with the setup process.<br /><br />Using the camera for daily use is a breeze. The video quality is excellent and the pan/tilt feature allows you to see an entire room easily. The app also works well and allows you to set up notifications to alert you if motion is detected. This ensures that you will not miss anything moving in the room that you have the camera setup in. The app also gives you the ability to speak through a speaker that is on the camera, so if you have a pet you could easily speak to them remotely.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this camera is an excellent option for anyone that is looking for a home security camera. The quality is excellent and while the app is not the greatest, it does do its job well enough.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>221141</td><td>R18P3RW2HBRI5L</td><td>B00L2GJBOW</td><td>795532479</td><td>Spy Pen Video Camera Audio Recorder By U-Guard Security Prod</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Grest product</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>50923817</td><td>RDJN88ERJ3H04</td><td>B00HV4XHX0</td><td>629357110</td><td>[2 PACK] Long Camera / Camcorder Neck Shoulder Straps Belt - Length Approximately 36\" + Cleaning Cloth in Retail Packaging (Multi-Color (Blue) + Black)</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Fast and accurate; just as advertised.</td><td>Being a larger than average photographer, I was having a hard time finding a long enough strap so my camera would hang comfortably.

I bought a wifi extenrder which is placed next to the main module to prevent having a long ethernet cable connects to my router.<br /><br />To not having long video cable from my backyard to the main machine, I installed a wireless camera (different brand) to cover my back yard.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Installation - plug and play (need to drill holes on garage wall for cables to go through is expected for this wired system).<br />2. Not noisy at all (don't know why some reviews complain about noise).<br />3. Price is reasonable.<br />4. Mobil application to view the video remotely works very well. Would be nice to allow mobil app to change cofiguration (e.g. motion detection) remotely.<br />Cons:<br />1. I get notifications from all four cameras when cameras switching from day (color) to night (black and white) mode and vise vesa. These anoying alarms can be prevented if the system is designed properly.<br />2. Picture attached in alarm notification e-mail is not very clear (hard to tell the details of a face).<br />3. PC/laptop application (Amcrest pro) does not work at all. It can not detect Amcrest device connected to the same router and there is no way to configure (UID) manually.  Same result after giving Amcrest tech support to access my laptop remotely.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>48363612</td><td>R6OHFC2MPYO2A</td><td>B00G9G76PQ</td><td>912641055</td><td>Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control with Storage Case for D40, D40X, D50, D60, D70, D70S, D80, D90, D600, D610, D3000, D3200, D5000, D5100, D5200, D5300, D7000, & D7100 SLR Digital Cameras, 1 J1, 1 J2, 1 V1, & 1 V2 Compact System Cameras, COOLPIX A, P7000, P7100, P7700 & P7800 Digital Cameras + 3 Replacement Batteries & HeroFiber Ultra Gentle Cleaning Cloth</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>seamless operation!</td><td>Use it this past weekend for a family portrait session.

Eventually I resorted to a Chinese GSM system but if you have ever tried that out you will know the term ' user unfriendly' was specifically created to decribe those systems. In came Korner and what a pleasant experience!<br />A few remarks:<br />One piece door contacts and real pleasing on the eye!<br />Absolutely user friendly - even a child can install them.<br />Direct control via an App on your phone.<br />Long battery life<br />The whole system is plug and  play.<br />Korner will send you an email as well as a pop-up on your phone if intrusion is detected.<br />Korner can be used as a door chime if not armed - so you can still monitor movement through the house even when it is disarmed.<br />Allthough the tags are meant to be used with doors/windows, I've dropped one in portable safebox at home and it works perfectly well to register movement of the box.<br />Very nice feature is that you can actually set up a circle of friends to be notified of intrusions - one can create your own personal neighbourhood watch system.<br />Customer service is excellent - I had a few questions/issues and time and again I was assisted in a prompt and efficient manner. Love the fact that the system is updated continiously (OTA) with new features and improvements.<br />The whole system is portable - so you can take it along if you move.<br />It deserves a 5/5.<br />Francois, South Africa</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>7234871</td><td>R2CMHWXJSV4YXI</td><td>B0088P5QOO</td><td>290684842</td><td>Progo Battery Pocket Rapid Travel Charger With Car & European Adapter for Sony NP-BG1, NP-FG1.

I'm a resolution fan, but 1280x720 really works, and made the budget low.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13945550</td><td>R1ZGXA8YE14TRO</td><td>B00MXVQ0YE</td><td>215818514</td><td>7 in 1 Fujifilm instax Mini 8 Instant Camera Accessories Bundles (Mini 8 Case/Mini Album/Close-Up selfie Lens/ Close-Up Lens/Hanging Frames/Film Frame/ Film Stickers)</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>The preteen loved it.

LOVE the ability to charge my 70D battery on the go!</td><td>I am forever misplacing the battery charger for our Canon 70D so I decided that it was time to order a back-up! This charger by Indie Camera Gear seems to charge just as fast as my Canon charger, and I love how compact it is so it doesn't take up extra outlets when plugged into the wall! It has a red light that comes on when charging and it turns green when it is fully-charged. This charger also has overcharging protection, meaning that you can leave it plugged in overnight and it won't fry your battery! Considering a replacement 70D Canon battery runs about $60, it is VERY nice to have that extra protection! I actually missed that there would be a car charging cable included when I ordered this, so I was thrilled to find that cable in the box! I take a crazy number of photographs every day and one thing I'm not so good about is remembering to stop and charge the battery! This is extra cable plugs directly into the charger and allows you to charge your battery while you are on the go! I love having a car charger for vacations as well because how often do you remember, or have time to charge your camera battery at the hotel? I purchased this charger during a limited promotional period at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for either a back-up or a replacement charger! It sure beats spending $50-80 for an OEM charger!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>12031482</td><td>R7PLTXCQOXE16</td><td>B00J59R95Q</td><td>792542602</td><td>GGS Optical Glass DSLR LCD Screen Protector for Sony Alpha a7 a7R Digital Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Does the job.</td><td>Fits well and adds protection to the viewer on my camera.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>11736306</td><td>R1MIRDB9OBMM3I</td><td>B00007EDZG</td><td>479032842</td><td>Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>works well</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1609987</td><td>R29LIXAK3E6M1F</td><td>B00Y1ZCQCK</td><td>498684526</td><td>Accessories for Gopro Monopod Tripod & Float Bobber & Chest Belt Strap Suit for GoPro Hero 3+/3/2/1 SJ4000 Xiaomi Yi Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>fast shipping will do more business</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52977496</td><td>R18SPO7W3DVN43</td><td>B00H3Q8QB4</td><td>826842790</td><td>Foscam FI9821P Plug & Play 1.0 Megapixel 1280 x 720 Wireless/Wired Pan/tilt IP Camera with IR-Cut</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>SUCCESS!</td><td>I had a hard time setting it up but Vincent from Technical support walked me through the setup and got it working.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>25013619</td><td>R3PHJP3QAPWLVA</td><td>B00O9S08Z6</td><td>85219147</td><td>Neewer VK750 II Pro i-TTL Auto-Focus Flash for Nikon DSLR Camera Deluxe Kit with Accessories (10 Items)</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Just as advertised.

Lens</td><td>Camera</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Don't Over Look This Lens</td><td>This is the first lens I bought for my Lumix G1, the reason, having no experience with Lumix lenses, was that Panasonic claimed that this lens was developed by Leica for the M4/3 system.  I have owned this lens for many years now. Frankly, I have not been disappointed.  The lens is impressive as it yields sharp balanced images,  I was not really expecting much at the the time, but it has proven to be a good value.  Since then I have bought many other Lumix and Leica lenses for my G1 and GX7, but I still use this lens frequently.  Last week I decided to give away my entire Nikon system that I used in my profession, a tough decision letting go of and old friend, but I had not really picked it up since I bought this lens. This lens has dampened focusing, or so it seems, and is easy to focus accurately, it is certainly a faster focusing lens than my equivalent Nikkors.  It is light weight.  I carry it in a fishing vest, along with several other lenses. and it gets bounce and banged around when I scurry up and down slopes to get a good position and it has held up well.  In terms of image characteristics it performs similar to my Zeiss lenses on my Hasselblad.  I like to make oversized prints and this lens serves well.  Lumix makes so many good lenses it is hard to know which to buy, I don't regret this purchase.  As a user of may old lenses by Zeiss, Leica and Schneider I would put this lens in the same class. The selection of glass has always been highly subjective relative to one's photographic tastes, so look at some test images to get a feel for the lens.  I really like it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>35033403</td><td>R23SFHD8IAN3UM</td><td>B009F8UE4K</td><td>168397395</td><td>MaximalPower_29</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great</td><td>But unfortunately I had to return the item because I received a new camera for my Birthday</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>49523782</td><td>R2GC63EU3MBG0R</td><td>B0116Q3U4Y</td><td>387804619</td><td>Xvim Security Camera System CCTV Surveillance System with 960H DVR 4pcs 900TVL Cameras Outdoor Metal Housing Weatherproof Hard Drive Not Included -100feet Night Vision -IR Cut build in -Quick Remote Access via smart phone</td><td>Camera</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>(video test and demo) Works awesome, simple to setup compared to other systems</td><td>[[VIDEOID:902e8616169ea6ef371d58868ce0a0e]] ✏️ Quick thoughts to supplement my video demonstration.<br /><br />Everything you need is included except for a monitor (one that accepts either HDMI or VGA) and a hard drive (just a basic laptop hard drive, \\\\\"SATA\\\\\" like this one: [[ASIN:B00AAKF8KC Generic 320 GB 320GB 2.5 Inch Sata Laptop Internal Hard drive 5400 RPM For Laptop/Mac/PS3 (320 GB)]].<br /><br />I like this security system because:<br />- It's very easy to setup. Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included). Click around and right click to \\\\\"go back\\\\\" in the navigation.<br />- Very smooth, excellent quality footage.  Not like that choppy stuff you see on old CCTV security systems.<br />- Tons of long cables. 60 foot cables (8 of them!). Note: Due to the length of the cable, there's a slight 1 second delay from the event to when you see it on your monitor.<br />- Full metal, tough camera design.<br />- Awesome in low-light/darkness. Infrared lights work wonderfully to light up the room when it's dark. (of course the human eye can't see infrared, but it lights up enough for the camera to film everything)<br />- Incredibly good price here on Amazon. Just factor in a hard drive and a monitor.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this camera system. An excellent bang for your buck, especially considering how many cameras they give you.<br /><br />I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration.

Had to run all the cat6 wires to where I was going to set up my cameras since these are indoor camera wanted to make sure they did not get wet.  One thing that you must do before installing the camera is to program them to the NVR to make sure they work before you put them up. I suggest doing this first. The instructions are not to clear about doing this. I had to call Amcrest technical support for the NVR. It took a while to get through but they were very helpful and also assisted me setting up my phone app that I downloaded from the Play store. You have to download the right app for whatever phone you are using or it will not work. For the Samsung Galaxy phones I downloaded the  Amcrest view lite app. it work fine so far. Over all for the price these are pretty good cameras I like the option that the can pan and tilt to get a better view of the area. The have a built in speaker which I have not gotten to work with the NVR yet you can also use a Microphone with them still working on that. Write more at a later date when figured out how to make them work.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>3937898</td><td>R2S4WC2QGJ3YIC</td><td>B00P0V0W1Q</td><td>654129912</td><td>niceEshop(TM) Vintage Universal Camera Single Shoulder Sling Belt Strap For SLR DSLR Camera,Black White</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Vert sturdy.

If you are using a GE or Interlogix panel with this model it should be very easy to add to your existing system. Be sure to download your wireless panel's user manual, as you these smoke alarms usually need to go onto a dedicated group/zone, and be setup as a specific sensor. If you are using a monitored Concord 4 system, be sure to add the sensor text as &#34;smoke or fire alarm,&#34; and perhaps a location (which I did not as I don't really care where the fire or smoke is, I just want to know my house is on fire) so that the monitoring company will know that it's a fire emergency and not a police emergency. If you don't name this sensor I believe it will only tell the monitoring company that Sensor #XX has been tripped. I would recommend getting more than one unit for your home, and installing these yourself as it's free. It's definitely simple enough to do by yourself, provided you follow the instructions closely.  Update: My spouse burned some bacon this morning and this thing definitely works. It's quite sensitive.

The SmaPole F1 Gopro handle is made of a carbon fiber body and metal gopro mount. I think Smatree made a great handle even better by using these materials. I have another brand handle but it's constructed of plastic and foam for the handle. Smatree took it a step further and used a much lighter and stronger material which is great. The SmapPole is longer than my other handle by about 4-5&#34; but this brings the camera further away giving a little bit more distance giving you a wider shot. I do see one thing that many mention, is that it has no grip built in the carbon fiber handle. This is very minor being that they include a detachable wrist lanyard that has an adjustable lock to keep it from sliding off your wrist. For those of you who have a mini tripod, you can screw the end of this handle to extend the height. All in all, I think this is a great product for the price being that it's made of real carbon fiber and all metal construction.

It stayed on my head great and at no point was I worried about losing the GoPro.<br /><br />Fantastic deal for getting a multitude of accessories with a carrying case. 5 stars.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4274230</td><td>R25ZI03NYWAEZH</td><td>B00T5OCCVC</td><td>342999869</td><td>Yongnuo Flash YN600ex-rt Wireless HSS 1/8000s Master Flash Speedlite for Cannon Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>This is finally the one!</td><td>I have been into taking photographs for 17 years now. Often needing a flash, that had this issues with this, that and the other thing. But with this flash, it's so intuitive for any photographer. Because of it's ETTL computer. Taking 99% out of the quess work out of your work! Such as how far to flash. How much power to flash, etc? With the zoom flash you can reach out to 200ft. Placing enough flash tword your subject, to get the shot. I have had no issue with reported over heating? So far I have used this flash during 14 weddings, with no issues. I would recommend this flash to a friend! Oh one more thing. The price for this flash verses Cannon. Which doing EVERYTHING THE CANNON DOES! Was my BIG PLUS TO BUY!

No matter how much you jerk around when flying, the videos turn out great.  There are a lot of steps to turning everything on and back off at the end.  That takes a little getting used to.  It is very easy to fly.  My 9 year old grandson visited last week and was very good at flying it.  He really enjoyed it.  The DJI website lacks a little.  I was trying to change a setting on the drone per instructions from a youtube video and never could figure out how to do it.  Even the youtube video said it was a difficult website.  What I wanted to change wasn't that important.  The overall is that I'm very happy with the purchase.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>17972876</td><td>R3UDLF7AKSYYAA</td><td>B00GETGHT4</td><td>288945120</td><td>1 X Suction Cup Mount +Tripod Adapter For GoPro HD HERO HERO2 HERO3 Camera ST-61</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Excellent</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>9937168</td><td>R2SEDMBOS2N8PX</td><td>B00K5552GW</td><td>244521177</td><td>0.35x Altura Photo Lens</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>but I love photography.

I use it for a huge variety of tasks, from windshield suction cup mounts( for Autocross, Track driving, and cross country trips), sticky mounts for gokarting, helmet cams( on bikes, cars, kayaking, and jet skis), on my drone (DJI Phantom), and just for goofy monopod mounts.  It has legitimately never let me down in my one year (almost) of ownership and I'll probably order 2 or 3 more in the coming months as my other contour mounts age.  The only issue I can think of is that pairing this with super cheap aftermarket gopro adapter stick things (you know... the little sticks with the bolts through them) requires you to torque the living heck out of the bolts (I keep a multi tool with me anyways... so not a problem for me). But if I use legit gopro equipment or the higher end aftermarket stuff I dont have an issue.  Sticks to my Contour +2 and Roam2 like glue and has survived many a fall.

I received a free sample for unbiased review. The opinions expressed are my own.<br /><br />My Fujifilm camera has a flip-out LCD screen and it can be very difficult to see the screen when outside on sunny days. This simple solution helps with that. It attaches around the LCD panel with a simple velcro tab and is removed as easily as it is put on, It does exactly what it's supposed to do; reduce glare and reflections on the LCD panel.<br /><br />Not too much else to say about this.  It's helpful to have, doesn't cost much and works as advertised.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>17065779</td><td>R30JCDPNZNYIDM</td><td>B00H2VSTG2</td><td>747879064</td><td>Dahua IPC-HFW2100CP POE and ONVIF 1.3 MP Network Outdoor Bullet Camera H.264</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Image and construction quality are great!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>3286210</td><td>RCS6IWPIBUYID</td><td>B00W4EKGHW</td><td>18461277</td><td>Nikon D3300 Camera with Nikon 18-55mm VR Lens Al’s Variety Premium Bundle with Deluxe + Tamron 70-300mm Zoom Lens Gadget Bag + 2pc Filter Kit + XIT Wide Angle Lens + XIT Telephoto Lens + Tripod + 32GB Bandwidth Memory Card + 15pc Accessory Bundle Kit</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Very good Camera.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>10434701</td><td>R3H4SNF45PNSJI</td><td>B0007WK8L2</td><td>634625084</td><td>Canon ET-67B Lens Hood for EF-S 60mm f/2.8 Macro USM Digital SLR Lens</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Great!

This definitely has more attachments and accessories included. All of the stats are very similar as well. It is a complete package with lots of great useful pieces included.<br /><br />You can record video, capture a single photo, capture photo burst, shoot a series of photos of the set interval time, watch video and photo playback adjust camera settings and resolutions and much more. Its quick to pick up even for the not so tech savvy. I count myself in that group. It literally does it all. If you're into filming or shooting photos this is definitely for you. The video is extremely high HD quality.<br /><br />We have really enjoyed learning about this camcorder. We have been testing its abilities. I love that it's versatile. If you can dream it up I guarantee there's a mount out there for it. I'm working on filming my cooking for my blog currently. I'm a chef by trade. I find this camera easy to use and operate by myself. This camera is perfect for a one person operation. Since, I'm cooking, I really like that it's water resistant. Spills happen! It really is a professional quality HD camera. It's amazing to me that it fits in the palm of my hand. This is perfect for using solo you can mount it easily to most anything.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this for everyone. Once you get it you'll think of 1 million reasons to use it. The audience for this camera and equipment is endless. It would make a great gift for anyone. It's not just for sports enthusiast. New parents or grandparents,<br />College-bound students, entrepreneurs, anyone with a YouTube channel, teachers or most everyone would love to receive this as a gift. It definitely fits most budgets. It's the same quality for half the price of the most popular sports camcorder.<br /><br />I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.

For a brand new high-tech product it worked surprisingly well straight out of the box. I had a few questions and tech support replied pretty quickly. As it's so new it means it will continue to get even better. Obviously the app can be upgraded as new versions are released, but the hardware's firmware can also be upgraded automatically without you having to do anything.  Korner is so simple that my mother could set it up. It's pretty fun too. Just add a couple of remote CCTV cameras and you'll have an awesome home security system for very little money.  The alarm on the app needs to be much more aggressive to get your attention if one of the tags is triggered, but I'm told they're working on that.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>25135886</td><td>R2GS9UD74QA7L</td><td>B00IPVLFIM</td><td>32693950</td><td>52mm Front Lens Cap for Nikon D3000 D5100 D3100 D3200 D40 D60 with 18-55mm Lens</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>This is exactly like my original and I received it quickly</td><td>I lost my original lens cap somewhere in Yosemite!<br />This is exactly like my original and I received it quickly.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1861634</td><td>R2Y8QHW29MOTKN</td><td>B00ATM1MGA</td><td>396879637</td><td>Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR 16MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black) (OLD MODEL)</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>A good camera for newbies</td><td>A really good camera for point and shoot.

It came with a kit that has all the parts you need to utilize this camera the way you'd want. The camera seems fragile but it isn't. Good quality camera that has all the functions. It's so tiny too and has a screen. It has fish eye lens that can zoom 4x. The wifi is cool that you can transfer image to your phone or tablet. It's just an awesome little camera. It's durable though. I played catch with my son and he wore it and the football would smash into the camera and the camera even took a tumble and it still maintained as though nothing happened. The price is super amazing. I got it as a lighting deal and it was a steal of a deal in my opinion. Thanks<br /><br />Now the cons are that there's no instructions manual. I feel like there's a lot more that I should be able to do but can't do it yet. Then again it's fun discovering new things about a device, but a link to instructions would be nice. Also there's so many attachment kits and it's hard to know what is what. A YouTube link showing all the feature would be awesome to solve this. The app could also be better. It's a bit laggy and slow. Maybe that's my device though. The buttons are so hard to figure out sometimes. I have trouble playing back the clip and fast forwarding. Also for some reason it stops recording at certain times. Like it'll record for a minute and stop and start a new clip. Again I feel that all falls on the functionality and instructions would help this. There may be a instruction link that I don't know of. If I do find it I'll use it and come back here to revise this review.<br /><br />Overall I gave this item a 5 star rating and rightfully so. It's a fun device that can be used by anyone for a wide range of things and the best part is that it's very cost effective. Also the quality and functionality of this camera is top notch. My kids have already asked for one for Christmas and I may oblige.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>41466286</td><td>R19U7UEI5FHKAH</td><td>B00TKLFA6O</td><td>443308689</td><td>OP/TECH USA Utility Sling Duo</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Distribute the weight of a heavy SLR</td><td>This item is exactly what I have been looking for.

Just like the underwater filters, these land filters fit very snugly/securely and your saving $40 when you buy a Three Pack over buying three filters individually. Polar Pro appears to have listened to feedback about their included synthetic tether because all three of my tethers that came with my pack (my Land Three Pack appears to be the newest version due to the Polar Pro's new logo on the storage bags compared to the old logo that was on my Underwater Three Pack storage bags) had their ends singed to prevent unraveling. That's a big plus and it's nice to know Polar Pro is willing to make improvements.<br /><br />The first photo I attached was shot using the Marco lens, with the setting on &#34;Medium&#34; width (Polar Pro recommends this setting with this lens). The second and third photos were shot with the Polarizer lens and in 12MP &#34;Wide&#34; width setting. If you buy both the Land and Underwater Three Pack Lens Filters, you will end up with two Polarizer lens filters. I plan to give the extra Polarizer lens filter to my friend and scuba instructor on Isla Mujeres, Mexico. She will get a ton of use from it!<br /><br />Keep up the great work Polar Pro!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>10147523</td><td>R3V8FKXIHBLWEL</td><td>B009ZM9R4O</td><td>840491020</td><td>Instax Parent</td><td>Camera</td><td>91</td><td>108</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>I love this camera</td><td>I love this camera!

I have an a-mount with a fairly cheap dummy adapter that works perfectly with my camera. I am able to take amazing shots, even in low light, that I was never able to do with the kit lens. I actually dread using the kit lens now, and have considered just getting rid of it and getting a smaller focal length prime Rokinon to replace it, as this 85mm you have to stand a considerable distance away from the subject to get a full body shot. I primarily take pictures of people at conventions and it does pose a problem with an 85mm prime, but if you want amazing portraits without breaking the bank this is the lens for you. I was skeptical at first about using a manual lens, but after figuring out the aperture ring, focus zoom, and the focus peaking I feel as though I'm not losing any time by not having autofocus. I will be in the market for another smaller focal length lens from Rokinon to add to my photography collection.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>21717524</td><td>RWKFL2ZNAH6OE</td><td>B00TPLRB16</td><td>36294660</td><td>Sabrent EVA Hard Carrying Case Pouch for External 2.5\" Hard Drive (EC-CASE)</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Pleased with Sabrent EVA Hard Drive Carrying Case</td><td>I use these small external hard drives to back up certain pictures or files from my computer.

I really need the EVF when under water. I can't see the back LED screen showing up in almost any of my cameras when under water. Why don't all the underwater cameras have a EVF! (Or any type of view finder!) Or do I need to invent one? Anyway, this case works great and the secret is to text out the bag before use. Put in some tissue paper etc...and seal it and text it. Before every shoot! If you see bubbles around the bag after a minute or two check it out. Don't keep swimming around.

Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included). Click around and right click to \\\\\"go back\\\\\" in the navigation.<br />- Very smooth, excellent quality footage.  Not like that choppy stuff you see on old CCTV security systems.<br />- Tons of long cables. 60 foot cables (8 of them!). Note: Due to the length of the cable, there's a slight 1 second delay from the event to when you see it on your monitor.<br />- Full metal, tough camera design.<br />- Awesome in low-light/darkness. Infrared lights work wonderfully to light up the room when it's dark. (of course the human eye can't see infrared, but it lights up enough for the camera to film everything)<br />- Incredibly good price here on Amazon. Just factor in a hard drive and a monitor.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this camera system. An excellent bang for your buck, especially considering how many cameras they give you.<br /><br />I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration. Hope demonstration and test helps!<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />👍 Yes, absolutely.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>46765277</td><td>R1APH8EIEYSVY7</td><td>B00KE6RQ6Q</td><td>828961889</td><td>AEE Technology Action Cam S71 4K 1080P 16MP Slim Body Wi-Fi Waterproof Wireless Action Camera with 2.0-Inch LCD (Black)</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>nice one</td><td>Fast shipping, the camera is very easy to use and comes with so many accessories, the video and pictures came out nice! definitely worth the money...</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>49442569</td><td>R3J8JK60SX976P</td><td>B00KBT0YD8</td><td>812370354</td><td>AFUNTA Head Strap Camera Mount Support For Gopro Hero4 Hero3+ Hero3 Hero2 Original Cameras, Xiaomi Yi, SJ Cameras</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>very good</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4562144</td><td>R283PJIMA427LN</td><td>B0049VMMZ2</td><td>934531573</td><td>Wasabi Power Battery and Charger for Canon BP-827</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Was an excellent purchase.

I am a beginner, and hearing interesting facts about what I am observing is really interested and makes me enjoy what I am looking at.<br /><br />- Very small!  The Schmidt-Cassegrain design is a fraction of the size of a regular, full-size 6&#34; scope (Dob, for example).  Super portable, but very powerful.  It is great to have such a small scope that performs as well as a much larger one.<br /><br />- Build quality.

The biggest problem is if you change papers or ink brands (even with the other two items calibrated), the color changes...and your back to square one it seems. Enter Spyder print this device creates printer profiles for each type of paper and ink you use. this gives you back control over the color of your prints.

When using different cameras the color can be slightly off to a great deal off, even with the same camera bodies. By making color corrected presets for each one, your photos closely resemble each other. I do recommend watching the videos on using the product for the first time( its just easier). This is the first step to color correction for your photos, Second is to edit them on a color calibrated monitor( a high quality monitor where the color output is 100% of sRGB, and as close to 100% of Adobe RGB really helps) Finally either send your photos off to a lab for printing or buy Spyder print  and calibrate your printer.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>18824089</td><td>R5SAGHW3EUUOS</td><td>B010FJYQBE</td><td>444439291</td><td>Aluminum Replacement Rear Snap Latch Standard Waterproof Housing Buckle Lock for GoPro Hero 3+, Hero 3 Plus, Hero 4 Camera(Purple)</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>So far, pretty excellent.</td><td>Caveat: I've only had this on the camera for a few days, so I can't speak to durability yet.

But no one made a compact size case shaped for GoPro like Shineda able to carry up to 2 GoPro cameras inside. Fine ends and attractive colors create a natural space for your action camera and all the accessories you might think of. The Shineda Grid Case is foam cut-out system to take all your GoPro accessories inside: A GoPro plus case, SD cards cut-out, remote cut-out, and a double space cut-out for carrying large gear amongst others. The foam inside is PET to keep this way the case undeformable. When you open the Shineda Grid Case you'll see a grey flap on the left compartment which you can move.  Once you've done this you will find a new full bungeed section to carry more gear such as cables, your charger, thumbscrews, flat adhesive mounts, spare batteries, quick release buckle, etc. In case you wanted to carry even more gear, you can always remove the bungeed section on the left flap and that way you can create more space. The Grid Case can resist water but it is important to understand this: light rain or water splash so don't dive it. Made of EVA: Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) an extremely elastic material that can be sintered to form a porous material similar to rubber, yet with excellent toughness. As they mention, the Grid Case is the only case with 3 neoprene pockets for filters, that a great plus and thumbs up for the company! The Grid Case is a so well organized case that will make your life easier once out there.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4169920</td><td>R5URHU86D28C3</td><td>B00OZPQFKK</td><td>892909443</td><td>Sigma 18-250mm f3.5-6.3 DC MACRO OS HSM Lens with UV, CPL, FLD, ND4 and +10 Macro Filters for Nikon D7200, D7100, D7000, D5500, D5300, D5200, D5100, D3300, D3200 and D3100 Digital SLR Cameras</td><td>Camera</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>It can't get any better at this price!</td><td>I love this lens. I bought this couple months ago after doing a lot of online research. I would like to consider my photography skill at an intermediate level ;-) and when I wanted to go for big zoom lens for my NIKKON, I did not want to spend too much of money. But I still wanted a full time lens which will cover most of Indoor and Outdoor range. And this fits the bill perfectly. I shot more than a thousand pics without changing the lens both indoor and outdoor including landscapes and close ups. The results are very good. Most important is that the clarity it produces is consistent throughout the length. It adds little noise at the max zoom but its not bad. Its very little. Best thing is I don't have to change the lens. And in auto mode it achieves satisfactory results. Perfect for little lazy people like me to keep changing lens and all settings like modes, aperture, exposure etc and still want to capture images which are worthy of compliments. :-) I definitely recommend for people like me who want to go further than entry level DSLR photogrphy!<br />The package came with lot of accessories.

Even though the shots are only 5MP, they are amazing clear.  The great thing, however is the optical zoom.  The resulting picture quality is actually better than on the iPhone 6 with its digital zoom. Landscapes over a mile away come out clear. The quality in doors is good, too.  There is a built in flash, plus a hot foot.  I expected the 5MP to limit the photos to web and facebook use, but I can actually blow these up to 11 by 14 and still have great quality due to the quality of the optics.

I have played around with the settings a few times and still have some more playing to do, but overall I am extremely happy with my purchase!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>14739734</td><td>RFX8ZQVYCWQJF</td><td>B001DYE1B6</td><td>801012793</td><td>Tamron Aspherical IF Macro Zoom Lens for DSLR Cameras</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>... on a trip recently and so far am very happy with it</td><td>I took this lens on a trip recently and so far am very happy with it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13644474</td><td>R3R0UG8ARDEI64</td><td>B0050R67U0</td><td>974098160</td><td>MagicFiber Complete</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Perfect for tablet screens</td><td>Bought these to clean fingerprints off the screens of our tablets and they work great.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>12516845</td><td>R2Y5C9XYV1C04J</td><td>B00OAAUZO2</td><td>54976291</td><td>Wasabi Power Battery & Charger for GoPro HERO4 and GoPro AHDBT-401, AHBBP-401</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>love it</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1857911</td><td>R2R72UAK4ENNX4</td><td>B00NXPZKAE</td><td>243287075</td><td>Sinvitron QZSD-06 Aluminum Camera Tripod Ball Head Ballhead+Quick Release Plate Pro Camera Tripod Max Load to 15kg Q-06</td><td>Camera</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Excellent value and quality.</td><td>I bought the Q06 to replace the aging head on my mono-pod.

The ONLY downside to this purchase is the two lights. They get really hot, so after a few minutes you won't want to adjust them. And they don't emit much light. They need to be super close to the product you are photographing. The whole thing is so inexpensive... it didn't bother me to get rid of the lights.

Better than F1.2 in multiple areas!</td><td>I was really excited when I saw the annoucement of this lens.

This was a surprise as this has similar features to Panasonic's most expensive lens, the 42.5mm F1.2 O.I.S but for 1/4 of the price. I really wanted to see how this compares to both the Olympus 45mm 1.8 and the expensive F1.2 from Panasonic so I set up some tests and was VERY impressed.<br /><br />This lens is slightly sharper in the center and quite a bit sharper in the corners compared to the Olympus at the same price while also including O.I.S. They F1.2 is sharper but not by that much and only visible when pixel peeping. Another big surprise was the minimum focusing distance. This is getting close to being a macro lens, much closer that you can get with the Olympus 45mm 1.8 or Panasonic's F1.2.<br /><br />I would strongly suggest this lens if you need something in the focal length. If you want to see my testing you can look up Max Yuryev 42.5mm on Youtube and you'll find my detailed comparison along with downloads to check out raw images comparison images/video for yourself.<br /><br />Pick this lens up you won't be disappointed!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>42571049</td><td>R2U2DDY3628AFO</td><td>B00181S1F6</td><td>88990778</td><td>Pelican 1690 Camera Case With Foam (Desert Tan)</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>These cases are very nice, plenty of room for the gear and it ...</td><td>These cases are very nice, plenty of room for the gear and it rolls well.

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, the camera itself is actually made by Tenvis - you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note -this camera may be available from a few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!may be available from a few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>22358649</td><td>RKWW5H4ZN4I83</td><td>B009FGS6LA</td><td>24993489</td><td>VideoSecu 4 Pack Dome Dummy Fake Infrared IR CCTV Surveillance Security Cameras Imitation Simulated Blinking LED with Security Warning Stickers C4B</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>They look real!

I wont go into all this details you can find them plenty already with graphs and all kind of smart numbers. I just want to say to all of you who wants to have the most advanced camera in the world and enjoy holding it and do what you love with such a pleasure and satisfaction, just BUY it !!!<br />I use Metabones IV adapter for my Canon lenses. I have one L 100mm and another one Tamron which is very good too. Both of them work just fine. Focusing is a bit slower but I use manual no bid deal for me. Later I will buy Sony Lenses. But meantime this camera and my Canon lenses do a fantastic job. I switched off all not needed stuff which drains the battery, and I don't shot video at all, only photos.<br />There is no Perfect anything in this world, but this camera is much closer to perfection than anything out there. Thank you Sony for a great product.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>15790303</td><td>R37RSSK6FMU7UD</td><td>B00XXSO4BC</td><td>158732026</td><td>[Most Powerful Jaws Clamp Mount] Sametop Superpower Jaws Clamp + Flex Gooseneck Mount Adjustable Neck for Gopro Hero4, Hero3+, Hero3, Hd Hero 2, Hero, Original Hd Hero Cameras</td><td>Camera</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Durable clamp and flexible gooseneck.  The gooseneck/clamp attachment needs improvement</td><td>I had the clamps for a 7 weeks and the clamp attachment broke off like others reviews have stated.  I contacted the owner and he sent me a new one immediately.  As with other reviews the clamp attachment is an issue.  The way around this is to not separate the clamp and the gooseneck.  For the price and the quality of the clamp and gooseneck compared to others, I will just leave the 2 together.  The gooseneck moves easily and is sturdy.  The clamp is durable and grips well.  I very much like this product and use it frequently.  I mostly clamp it to a  fence board or fence pole and use at the baseball field.  I also plan on using it for basketball.  Just need to figure where I will clamp it.  I am open to suggestions!<br /><br />I gave this product 5 stars due to the durability of the clamps, the flexibility of the gooseneck, the price, and the seller's response to issues.

The lens is sharp, focus is fast and accurate. The optical finder is FANTASTIC when working in situations where the LCD screen is difficult to see. I had several other point and shoots before which had screens that made shooting almost guesswork, as you so often could not see the screen, even with a flip out hood on it. With this, I hardly ever look at the screen, as the finder works so well, it zooms right along with the LCD image. The only time the finder is not good is for closeups inside a couple of feet or so, because it is not through the lens, but rather a &#34;tunnel&#34; finder, meaning that while it works with the lens, the viewing is through a finder tunnel. Thus, at the very close distances, there is parallax error. So, when shooting at close distances, I just go back to using the screen. This camera is also very small, easily goes into a jacket pocket, pants pocket, even some shirt pockets. It also will use AA batteries, instead of something which has to be charged. Of course, if you prefer, you can buy rechargeable AAs and a charger, but if you are caught out somewhere, you can use regular AAs. Lithium type are preferable on the AAs, but alkaline will work, also. If using alkaline AAs, especially with flash, battery life may be a bit short. This accepts SD cards, so no problem with storage on it. You can vary file size (MP), I prefer to keep it at 16MP, and I have 20&#34;x30&#34; prints on my wall which are pretty sharp at that level. Video on this is adequate, as is sound, for a point and shoot. On video and sound, though, keep in mind that this is a tiny point and shoot camera, and should not be compared with DSLRs which cost 5-10 times and much and are also bigger and heavier. For a still camera, I don't think you could do much better in a point and shoot!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1630286</td><td>R2JLA0SR2TD0YD</td><td>B00DS2MXTS</td><td>845984365</td><td>Fujifilm Mini 8 Instant Camera</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Love it!</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>43424970</td><td>R2PSPRD77T0ZUK</td><td>B00O1F18IS</td><td>94636837</td><td>Rec-mounts Conversion Adapter 【Gp-cn-kw】gopro to 1/4 Camera Screw (Tripod Fixing Screw) (Aluminum Model)hdr-as100v Hdr-as30v From Aluminum Gopro Mount</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Superb build quality</td><td>Material is very sturdy, with very tight connections.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>23817538</td><td>R3FLBBLHT9VDJQ</td><td>B00GBVFAMU</td><td>824072169</td><td>SFBAY Pro Remote Shutter Release Connection Cable Compatible with RM-S1AM Replacement Commander for Sony Alpha DSLR A900 / A850 / A800 / A700/ A560 / A550 / A500 / A450 / A400 / A350 / A300 / A200 / A99 / A77 / A65 / A57 / A55 / A37 / A33</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Good product</td><td>I tried it with a37 and a65.

I was surprised on how well it folds down in such a compact way that it would not take as much room. The suction cup part performs exactly like the gopro branded one, in that you press the center button on the mount while bringing the lever down to lock it onto a smooth surface. This mount is different than the gopro brand because it has an extra pivoting head. I was able to tighten all thumb screws to prevent any movement and was satisfied that it would move while filming. Although I do suggest for any brand mount outside a vehicle to use a leash or tether just in case it loses suction. I usually use an old shoe lace cut very short and tie it some where to stay secure and not flap around in the wind. If you are going to use it on any glass I also suggest a good cleaning of the glass to get the best grip. I really like this mount and think it is a great alternative to paying double if not triple for the name brand product.

Initially I had trouble identifying which filter I needed, but the staff at Polar Pro were helpful. The GoPro Hero 3 housing is the same as the dive housing. The filter stayed on well. I used the tether and the string got in my footage the first day. So if you use it, make sure you tuck away extra string. It stayed on the camera securely entering and exiting the water on six boat dives, and during our dives with a strong current. It was cool to see the reddish tint disappear as soon as camera was immersed, even on a shallow dive.

I should say I don’t live in a particularly dangerous neighborhood, but I do like to feel safe. I might be a bit paranoid, but I believe it’s always easier to prevent problems than solve them.  I tested these cameras for about a week now and I am absolutely THRILLED. The guy who installed them was very professional and they catch almost all critical angles. I watched some of the videos and the image is very clear – I could definitely identify any person who would try to break in, even at night.  Also, they are very easy to use. I cannot tell you about installation because I preferred to call someone to do it for me, but after that I had no problems at all.

Sometimes the power dis for few seconds and cameras with no internal battery just die or reset!)<br />- Intuitive app with live streaming from ANYWHERE!

In addition, I now have access to Aperture, Shutter and ISO controls so I have total control of the image. Speaking of apperture controls, I can even now get a shallow depth of field as long as the subject is close... something that I could never do with my smart phone.<br /><br />Before I got this phone, my walk around camera was a Sony RX100MKII, that camera has not been used in months, most of my snap-shots are now being taken with the CM1 and when I want to get really creative or need top notch quality I use my A6000.<br /><br />As for the phone, I have no issues thus far. I just updated the handset to Lollipop and the phone is great. I am a T-Mobile user and it is great to get a break on my monthly service because I own the handset (of course for $1000, I better get a discounted service plan) and I like that Panasonic didn't give the phone a stupid skin or tons of bloatware that I would never use. This phone is very close to a pure Android experience with the exception of the camera app and the timelapse app, but these are great and where really needed given the features that this camera offers.<br /><br />I have added some pictures so you can see the results, I am a happy camper and will keep this as my phone for a long time... at least until Panasonic ore someone offers a better camera in their phone than this one.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>20128946</td><td>R293PXPV760GHA</td><td>B006YYS832</td><td>745889638</td><td>Replacement CB-USB5 CB-USB6 CB-USB8 USB Cable Cord for Olympus C-55 Zoom, C-5500 Sport Zoom, C-7000, D-425, D-435, D-545, D-595, D-630, Evolt E-30, E-330, E-400, E-410, E-420, E-450, E-500, E-510, E-520, E-600, E-620, E-M5, Pen E-P1, E-P2, E-PL1, EPL1s, E-PL2, E-PL5, SP-310, SP-320, SP-350, SP-500UZ, SP-510UZ, SP-550UZ, SP-560UZ, SP-565UZ, SP-570UZ, SP-588UZ, SP-590UZ, SP-610UZ, SP-700, SP-800UZ,</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>exactly as described..</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52028014</td><td>R181L9DSHI8OJN</td><td>B00HQDBLDO</td><td>799915272</td><td>Nikon Coolpix L330 Digital Camera (Black)</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>it takes great pictures - I am quite pleased with it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>43366504</td><td>R153A4143PNAJU</td><td>B000BAX50G</td><td>347398788</td><td>Lowepro SlingShot 100 All-Weather Digital Camera Backpack - Black</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>This bag is well built and well padded.

I just tried the SD-208 -SD-165 little brother- and the results are spectacular as always. The SD-208 is a super compact pole extendable up to 36&#34; (91.44cm) and 11&#34; (27.94cm) folded with a nice foam grip handle at the bottom. Easy to use and extremely maneuvrable, great for water dives and very steady if you're recording. The SD-208 it is anodized aluminium alloy that makes it feel very light when use. It includes twist lock sections to lock the extendable pole which makes the SD-208 a very fast pole. Like its big brothers, it has a 1/4&#34; screw hole at the bottom. Thanks to this you can attach your selfie stick on a tripod. The only problem, is the wrist strap connector at the bottom: it give the sensation it can cut off at any time. The SD-208 comes in three colors: Black, Blue and Orange. As well, The SD-208 brings a tripod mount and a thumbscrew, these mechanism allows you to move your GoPro up and down just loosing the thumbscrew.

It is very flexible allowing you to wrap it around pretty much anything . But I do warn you the legs are similar to POP beads ( just  aged my self lol ) and are prone to pinching your fingers a bit when adjusting it. This also works as a desk top tri-pod for up close pix or self movies. The mount does hold my Larger Galaxy Note edge with out issues as well as my husbands Samsung s5 with its bulky case. I would have liked to see a blue tooth remote with this item vs the lenses though as it would allow for taking pictures with out having to use the timer function on your phone. The lenses that came with this kit are ok i do find that I have to take the case off my phone hence rendering it vulnerable to drops while using it , so don't see my self using them very often as I am not willing to risk a drop . I would recommend this  mount for the selfie lovers out there as it will allow you the flexibility you dont have now and extend your picture taking ability beyond that of the traditional selfie stick.

It was fatiguing to use because the greater the magnification, the smaller is the opening in the eyepiece AND the less light there is. Worst of all, you see your own eyelashes quite a bit.<br /><br />Oh..yeah...you also had to put thing onto slides.<br /><br />With this, once the software is installed, you can place anything under it and capture steady video images. No slides need. And no getting your own eyelashes in the way.<br /><br />This more in line what what you envisioned looking in a microscope should be. Clear images. Not super high resolutions, but still -- all things considered, far better than what I could see in the microscope I had when I was growing up. At the same time, it's not too much of a shock in that I can capture similar images using my Nikon p600 in macro mode...although not at the level of magnification this microscope can reach.<br /><br />My youngest daughter is doing some preliminary explorations...a strand of human hair, a finger nail, bugs, etc and I'm hoping she'll be able to incorporate this into a school science project.<br /><br />Got this at no cost for unbiased review.<br /><br />∞ PositiveLogic</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>7774173</td><td>R1XV5TI87PTME6</td><td>B00BS4KUCK</td><td>67722115</td><td>DJI Phantom Prop Guards for Phantom 1 and FC40 (Set of 4)</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>worked well</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>20860123</td><td>R3OHRS3J672TMF</td><td>B00W8FN03Y</td><td>278285598</td><td>Canon EOS Rebel T6i 24.2 MP SLR Camera Bundle with Premium Accessories</td><td>Camera</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Very happy.
